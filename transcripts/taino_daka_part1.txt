(00:03) you have people saying that we don't exist why do people have a problem with me saying diana daca or doctor you know it's what because there's implications to that there's implications to what started 500 years ago five hundred and twenty years ago to what's going on today and around the world [Music] Christopher Columbus sailed the ocean sea in order to discover a new world [Music] [Applause]
(01:07) [Music] after Columbus a new migration began from Europe to America so therefore it is an international acknowledgement also that it is an important event where they say kill we know in South America and Central America Viva Puerto Rico Libre Colombia Cuba Europe Isis maybe not maybe bad waters lately in America but in fact he did discover America from the European media they're happy to see everybody here today I want to tell you
(02:21) that you first tonight native language by inner language why are we standing here in this spot in New York City today why because we choose to remember well heroku some people say it like that we remember what happened in 1492 we remember what happened the starting of a cycle that hasn't changed remember relatives Columbus is not a day it's a symbol not even up man this drum is a log drum and in the Taino language it's called a mile walk on and this is a
(03:29) quite a small one some of them can be quite large and this would be sort of like one of the main instruments set at a tie you know gathering I don't see being being Taino is pulling something off it's just just who we are the only people who have a problem with their identities these scholars who hang on to to a colonial narrative yes I would say that that the pre-colombian tyno population became extinct by the end of the 16th century by 1600 you can't really say that there were any pure blooded Tainos left any
(04:30) survival involved a mixture a mixture with the African population or a mixture with the European population or some combination of those two by the early 17th century so pure-blooded Tainos no such thing they're extinct tiny no identity I would say is motivated by an attempt to avoid identification with the African and African heritage which is seen as a negative in u.s.
(05:01) society and also in Puerto Rican society and in the spanish-speaking Caribbean in general and it's also I would say an attempt to avoid identification with Europeans especially the Spaniards because the Spaniards are seeing rightly so historically is colonizers oppressors individuals who employed slave labour and so on I became aware of my native heritage as a young boy both my parents were born on the island of Bora King which we know today as Puerto Rico my mother was the first one to to impart that knowledge to me and she was the
(05:55) first one who used the word Taino you know going over the history books and things like that I'm saying gee you know they really don't know who they are you know they're there's nothing here about you know their people and I I didn't know who their people was expect sex my uncle's in Puerto Rico so I went to the library and I found these books on the Taino they were like you know so I thought that was really interesting I said wow we have Indians in our in our family so I had brought him back for him so that he could look into it and then I
(06:30) went to my mother and I said ma do you know about the Tainos because she was living with me at the time but she said that my grandfather was part ii' no the fact we went to Niagara Falls and the first thing he wanted was a spear and an Indian hemp thing that was before he you know he do anything and I have pictures of him with that on yeah yeah I guess it's in the blood you know eventually comes out sometimes that starting of Christopher Columbus's journey over and the impact that had on indigenous peoples in the Caribbean and
(07:17) in the Taino people in particular because we were the first ones that were encountered in 1492 since that time with lost lands language and many of our people have lost pride in who they are so much so that within families our people are told yes we are native we are Tainos but don't talk about it you know don't bring attention to that to yourself so you have people going on for generations with that kind of mindset you know and then that allows a world to be built around people that continuously promotes one perspective of
(08:11) this historical encounter [Music] what's at stake here is respect for human rights and human dignity I think that's something that hasn't been really focused on many of us are one generation out of a rural environment you know meaning that our families lived in impoverished conditions and we remember that and not all of us were from families who have a long history of college etc and I don't think those voices have ever really been taken into account in the historical record and as a result of that you have people saying
(09:11) that we don't exist came to our lands and so forth we laid around as time went by we embraced the Spaniards and we worked with them sort of like you know what we'll work with you to help it make it better and this is after they enslaved us so that's a lesson to be taught how can we teach it to you if you won't allow us how can you how can we help you if you keep on trying to crush us I mean it's not about us it's about all of mankind it's all humanity and I think that as a native people we have that message and I don't
(09:51) think we're the only ones that have it how many people have walked up to all of us all of us oh but they're dead the history books say they're dead the history books say this Columbus Christopher compas was just wonderful man who came over here and saved us and oh my goodness he was a dog he was a crook he was a rapist he was deef so we're his men in order for us to be able to show everybody else that we're still here and that we do exist we have to come across to our own people because unfortunately a lot of them are ignorant
(10:21) to what's you know to two of their heritage and it's hard to be us I learned it the hard way from our own people and it would be nice that our own people when they see when they see that we have the strength to come out and to let everybody know listen we're still here you know we can get together this justice Brotherhood that we can start this nation all over again and we can help each other out instead of mocking us or you know thinking oh it's an loca you know oh you know those are things that they don't exist or whatever they should try to go
(11:01) back and read and look and learn and listen and try to get into that bring into like a unity but it has to start first from our own people what they took away from us we are taking back and giving back you know it's giving back to our kids so that they don't have to grow up with this wandering like like many of us did you know like well we have Spanish names but my grandmother was saying that we were Indians you know or guess almost Indians you know there so you know but how what do we have that reflects that besides you know ourselves
(11:40) maybe a you know what we have physically are they a bunch of racists no I wouldn't say the bunch of racists their racial ist's meaning that they accept this whole idea or notion or concept that you can subdivide the human species into these crude categories called races and they are crude categories European you know white people and so-called black people and when it comes to the Native American population even today I would say academics have said that just about all of the indigenous populations that that we have today are mixed to some
(12:28) degree I think the main issue has to do with historical tradition in the case of the Neo Tainos there there has been no official recognition by governments or for that matter academics or historians or what have you that that there is a historical tradition saying that oh within the Puerto Rican population Oh within the Dominican population you have this group that can be identified as indigenous whether they are pure or mixture or what have you well I would ask any Oh tiny No why why isn't Berto Rican Dominican or Cuban
(13:12) identity good enough why why privilege a Taino identity where does that get you how do you get access to jobs housing other types of benefits how do you accomplish your achieve upward economic and social mobility by identifying is Thai you know there's an ideology that says that poor Ricans and even Dominicans and Cubans Caribbean peoples even Jamaica has it has a slogan out of many come one and it's a construct of national identity for us in Puerto Rico what he came they say that we're the result of the the Taino the Spaniard and
(14:03) the African I see it this way if you look at the puerto recan you know Requa and you remove the tiny element out you don't have the same part of the canyon you don't have the same boricua however if you remove the spanish element or the african element we are still indigenous we're still taina starting in the 1980s and 1990s a number of so-called tribal groups emerged mostly based on what I've seen and what others others have seen in the mainland areas not on the islands and up here in the Northeast Connecticut New Jersey New
(14:58) York so that you have you know you have various so-called tribes we're here in Youngstown area of Ohio in a beautiful Woodworth Park and we are celebrating the summer solstice I'm a clinical manager of an addictions clinic I have my PhD I'm a professor also of Social Work at Youngstown State University I'm a professional woman and I am very proud of Who I am I've had to teach some of my colleagues some of my native brothers and sisters that we were the first people that Columbus encountered we were the first people and when we when we
(15:42) consider that we have been here since time immemorial that we have even traded far as far north as the state of Virginia the fact that we had traversed every part of this country the fact that we had traversed with the other native peoples of North America says that we we have been very very productive we have made a lot of contributions and we have influenced other native groups what car is going to be represented by a man holding in the effigy of a shark the shark is the trickster spirit in China tradition and it represents
(16:19) what car and there will be a battle between the shark spirit Hikari huh and yucca who the spirit of Hope the spirit of life the spirit of thriving and at the end at the culmination of that you have to shoot it with a strong arrows [Music] [Applause] have a story the red is for the blood we spilled when the black Columbus came to us the white is for the white has shined upon our innocence on the Sun and the Sun who shined upon our innocence and these are the colors that are we are now alive again and this is my dancing stick
(17:12) a way of thinking that came over from one side of the world has affected so many people 500 years later and we could look at the way the people who came over looked at the world and the natural environment the way they looked at other people's the discrimination because quote unquote a religion was different or they they they honored the world around them in a different way when you start to put all those connections together you start to see why the world is in the shape that it's in today because there's a certain mindset that
(18:02) was put forth and there was no opportunity for that sharing and learning right there was a real missed opportunity on the part of the colonizers because they wanted to shape the people on this side of the world on this side of the hemisphere into what they knew and what they understood and what they expected people to be you see for for them we shouldn't have even been here on this side of the world because their religious doctrine told them that that side of the world was the only side of the world that they were their only
(18:43) people so we shouldn't have even been here and I think that added to some of the aggression against our people would have on such as might a no name and in terms of how everything came about or my Indian Asst I was started when I was know started prior to that but I'd he at the age of 8 I was asked to come to the room and I was told you are not Latin you are not Hispanic you're not Spanish you are an Indian you're an arrow art ie no and don't you ever forget it and I never did and I started going to my first power I was actually
(19:29) in Manhattan they were kind of hidden at the age of nine and I've been in power trail for 35 years representing Taino culture and I do find pockets in South Carolina and North Carolina no matter what state I go to there are certain settlements communities that are still adhere to the Taino ways and identify themselves as Taino and people who try to teach others about Taino history and what we are today I sometimes ask them if they're aware of wounded needs and Wounded Knee and in the 70s is were they there they realize that they were Tainos
(20:16) they're being called names like [ __ ] Indian or Prairie [ __ ] which is why many of our people also resonate to other native peoples you know whether they're in the United States or or elsewhere it's because we understand that we came from that we we understand what they're talking about because we are indigenous peoples we come from that no we cannot help colonization the other thing is I'd like to know how many of these people are even Indians to begin with because I've looked at him and I have to tell you something they
