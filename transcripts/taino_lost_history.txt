(00:03) when we talk about the tyo few people even know what we're talking about everyone knows the Aztec everyone knows the Inca everyone knows the Maya you mentioned tyo and they go who are these people the name tyo itself is the generic term for the late prehistoric peoples of of the Greater Antilles and the Bahamas the big Islands Cuba uh Hispanola Puerto Rico and Jamaica in terms of national identity the people in Dominican Republic think of themselves as Indians not as people of African ancestry these are the people that
(00:36) greeted Columbus when Columbus arrived in the new world there were several million tyo already here living in the Greater Antilles knowing more about the tyos will help us understand that Clash of cultures you have two worlds that didn't have previous knowledge of each other coming together and initially misunderstanding each other fundamentally because they are trying to to fit them into the world as they understood it when in fact this was something totally new and un unprecedented there's a large number of
(01:09) indigenous population of tyo that were decimated assimilated or just disappeared uh within the first 10 to 20 years of contact with the new world caves have a very special role in in tyo culture they are sort of the way that this world is physically connected to the underworld where the spirits of the Dead dwell the tyos believed humans were created in two caves the tyo people came from one cave and all the nonino people came from another cave the pestal complex of caverns is really four waterfill caverns and then several
(01:55) others that are land and it's one of only now nine sites known with early Stone materials when I look at P noest what I look at its implications for the actual people of the Caribbean which is one of the last places in the world that was inhabited so 4 to 6,000 years ago we know people came into the Caribbean the question is where did they come from probably the first wave coming into the Greater Antilles came from the mainland probably Yucatan by boat came across inhabited Cuba inhabited Dominican Republic and we have evidence of that
(02:27) the manantial DEA I think has a special Place among caves and caverns in that it has a very vertical a direct vertical connection from a watery pool a watery underworld if you will through the surface of the Earth to the heavens and the only way you can explain these objects that date from oh 600 years before Columbus contact right off to time of Columbus is that they were offered underwater and they were preserved there in an anerobic no oxygen very little sunlight penetrating and that's Letta it has the largest
(03:04) diversity of tin objects of organic and ceramic that uh we've seen anywhere else and they were all placed there on purpose they were all offered to the gods the inner world what conception they had of a broader World beyond that we don't know Christopher Columbus was not not an accident his voyage into the new world were the result of many historical process es by 1492 the last Kingdom of Granada is won by the Christians and it is actually at that point that Christopher Columbus is able to gain the support of Queen Isabella
(03:42) and uh King Ferdinand for his voyage to the new world what he was looking for above all was to become the founder of a good family one that would have titles and Privileges and Renown down Through the Ages when we think of uh Columbus's first voyage me everyone knows Columbus sailed the ocean blue in 1492 he came with in the S the pinton the Santa Maria but not everybody knows that the first shipwreck of the Americas was the Santa Maria the Santa Maria ran gently up onto a sandbar Reef in present day Haiti well
(04:18) they couldn't get the ship off the reef so they had to make a decision Columbus was not able with only two small the two smaller ships remaining to bring everybody back to Spain they were able to actually used the materials from from the now to build a fort called lavidad and he left 39 men and he sailed off Columbus was of of the of the idea that there was a lot of gold in that area what he wanted to do was to have this fort over there so that they could start the trade with these people everyone knew he was coming back a little over a
(04:50) year later he comes on the second voyage he arrives at Navidad and what's he find smoldering Timbers everyone's dead there was a doctor with the group who said they looked like they've been dead about two weeks Columbus was thinking about trade but the Spanish were thinking about colonization they actually started to demand some things from the indigenous people and the indigenous people just did not accept that most probably it was the local tyos who who essentially finally decided they had to get rid of these people because they
(05:24) were too disruptive so he knows not to stay there he elects to go down the coast where he'd sell a year prior in a matter of several days it takes him 30 more days to make it 80 Mi down the coastline and he pulls into a place the river the Baho river that he had named and he says this is it this is the settlement of Isabella they brought a uh a priest they brought some women they brought animals they brought everything they need for a full- flesh colonization the the sort of backbone of the early Spanish Colonial economy was the right
(05:59) to to make demands on the labor of the tyos faino did not want to accept Christianity that person could could be enslaved one of the major sources of the writings of Father Las casus he had seen actually in uh in Cuba rivers of blood you know of of all the indigenous people that were um killed a massacre in the hands of the Spaniards they overworked the tyos in the gold mines and the the Spanish plantations they took them away from their Villages and their families at crucial points of the Agricultural Year from then on we're going to see that
(06:36) there's going to be a major um clashes uh actually in which many um spiners actually died at the hands of of the tyos the trigger at least as as the story has come down to us was when a Spaniard cut off a Tao's ear on a trumped up charge of theft the Spanish show up with hack butt rifles crossbows horses with uh Soldiers with lances but I would say that the most important weapon against the indigenous people was actually disease there are accounts of at least some tyos uh killing their children and then committing
(07:16) suicide rather than trying to face a world in which they could no longer cope the annihilation of the uh the the culture of the tyo and right in through the uh uh the Americas is well documented as small amounts of Spanish made huge influence because of their arms and weapons and their tactics they were there to conquer they were there to make a conquest if you look at the major transformations in human history and I don't care you know give me a list of the short list 5 8 10 12 I don't care how many you have to include in that
(07:49) list the unification of the old and new worlds into a single world after that everything is different from the way it was before people plants animals diseases ideas start moving all over the world in this sort of first great sweep of globalization a word that's much bandied about nowadays but the real globalization first occurs at the end of the 15th century in a sense they are the first people in the path of the hurricane and they deserve our our study and respect for that very reason tyos seem to have reacted to the Spanish
(08:37) in in different ways the Spaniards learned a lot from that first Contact in the Caribbean initially um relationships between the Spanish and tyo were were good there was a a sense of happiness and I my mind I'm envisioning how it occurred that when they're taking they're having party they're they're having small atos they're having to celebrate other beings neither side really understood who they were dealing with who the other was but they were at least cordial they traded with them that they were scared of them at some point
(09:19) but that they actually they traded trinkets that they gave them the guanin you know these uh these Golden Disc that that the shift and War people talk about the Spanish trying to enslave the tyos because Columbus at one point mentioned they would make good slaves and I think maybe he had some idea that they could do it but queen as Isabella nixed it so these are my subjects you can't enslave them in 1503 Queen Isabella um issued an order saying that um that they if an indigenous person um if faino did not want to accept Christianity that person
(10:02) could could be enslaved if they accept Christianity and they would be working for the spawners they had to pay um what would be could say like a like a salary to them the sort of backbone of the early Spanish Colonial economy was the right to make demands on the labor of the tyos they they're SE by the Spanish as to be servants they are there to work the minds because the Spaniard only have the thought of gold they overwork the tyo know in the gold mines and the the Spanish plantations they took them away from
(10:37) their Villages and their families at crucial points of the Agricultural year penalties for failure to produce are at least depicted as having been severe I don't doubt that they always were but you have to understand that a lot of what has come down to us about about this period isn't history it's propaganda Anda we have depictions of things like people being roasted uh of people having their hands chopped off I'm not saying that those kind of things didn't happen because I think they did but I think sometimes the scale gets
(11:20) exaggerated at the same time the the conquerors when they came they brought priests with them okay these Priests of course were supposed to minister to them however these priests when they came to the islands some said good things about them they fell in love with the Indians with the indigenous people but others did not one of the major sources of the writings of Father lassus uh Lascassas who his father and his uncle had been with Columbus at lizabella Lascassas initially came to the new world and was uh swinging a sword like
(11:57) everyone else going against the tyo as order Ed but he saw he saw the vision that these people were being annihilated and so really their rights the the one person that stood up was lascas actually he's going to make the case that um he had seen actually in uh in Cuba rivers of blood you know of of all the indigenous people that were um killed a massacre in the hands of the Spaniards they're going to be talking about the exploitation of the indigenous people and that is going to create a whole debate in Spain about uh um whether or
(12:30) not the indigenous people have a soul if these are actually human beings uh people who can actually learn to be Christians his writings which are probably our single most valuable written Source on tyo culture are are very sympathetic to the cause of the tyos start of the 16th century 1510 there abouts the resistance the Theo resistance took really took to heart took place because of the atrocities that were being committed from then on we're going to see that there's going to be a major um clashes uh actually in
(13:07) which many um spiners actually died at the hands of of the tyos the trigger at least as as the story has come down to us was when a Spaniard cut off a Tao's ear on a trumped up charge of theft the Spanish were exploring in the interior a group of them and they went to cross a river and so they took their clothes off uh to swim across and the leader then accused tyos of stealing their clothes it was a trumped up charge everybody knew it was a trumped up charge everybody knew tyos did not steal nonetheless this particular Spaniard
(13:49) used this incident as an excuse to to cut off a Tao's ear and it sort of went downhill from there there wasn't any any comparison for uh doing battle um you would have to sign in the sign of the the the old world technology the Spanish show up with hack butt rifles crossbows large uh dogs trained for as attack dogs horses with uh Soldiers with lances tyo weapons they did have bows and arrows but the weapon that the Spanish say they feared the most in which the most effective tyena weapon was a long Club known as a MAA was said
(14:37) to have been capable of crushing a man's scull even if he were wearing a steel helmet we had clubs we had Stones yes we had metal we had knives but they had weapons that we did not have they had cannons that was easy for to sub subjugate us to subject us to their will we got nothing out of them except death and disease you know we didn't have syphilis in the Caribbean until Columbus came to the Caribbean okay that was a European disease I would say that the most important weapon against the indigenous people was actually disease
(15:16) they do not know what small pox is that you do not know what to do that you see your faces and your body disfigured many people actually died out of that they did not know that if they tested and got some water and all that they could feel better and then keep fighting sort of active armed conflict um went on over a span of not quite 10 years as atrocities continue to to occur by the Spaniards where they hunted where they would tear down complete juka's Villages of people we have accounts of of people who found their world so changed so
(16:04) disintegrating so so unrecognizable that they felt they couldn't go on living in it and so there are accounts of at least some tyos uh killing their children and then committing suicide rather than trying to face a world in which they could no longer [Music] cope the annihilation of the uh the the culture of the tyo and right in through the uh uh the Americas is well documented that small amounts of Spanish made huge influence because of their arms and weapons and their tactics they were there to conquer they were there to
(16:43) make a conquest in terms of how many tyos there were in 1492 the estimates range very widely the low estimate is 60,000 this is for the island of Hispanola alone the most common figure you'll see is is 1 to 2 million uh I think that's that's a number that seems okay to me but it really is just a number I don't I don't think we have a particularly good handle on it maybe there's a million maybe there was a half million the point is there was a large number of indigenous population of tyo that were decimated ass simulated or just disappeared uh
(17:27) within the first 10 to 20 years of contact with the new world uh the Spanish arrival if someone were to ask me to describe the the Spanish impact on the tyos in one word I would say devastating but I would not say completely fatal I don't think the Spanish totally exterminated the tyo people those that didn't die from disease or from uh working the mindes or being forced into slave labor um were assimilated into the uh African blacks were being brought in starting in 1511 and so these cultures were becoming intermixed so I don't
(18:05) think the Ty were gone I think they're still here today certainly the Linguistics are here uh we talk about hurricane tyo canoe tyo manate tyo the word barbecue tyo there are people who identify themselves as tyo the largest and most active groups are in Puerto Rico the 2010 census that we just had there was a what is it a 48% increase in people identifying as Thao on the island in bing King that translates to about 19,000 people been a very important study was done now a few years ago under National Science Foundation University
(18:45) of Puerto Rico looking at genetics and looking at the uh traits of tyo that are in the genome and certainly we see that that's not to be unexpected first they went to remote Village areas then they went just to the general population and what they found was as many as 60% of the population in Puerto Rico is carrying the Genome of the tyo it is my job to go to Cleveland where there are 44,000 Puerto Ricans if we go by the statistics 60% of them are going to have tho Heritage Theo blood in them thino DNA they don't live the way tyos did 500
(19:22) years ago but we don't live the way our ancestors did 500 years ago but they do try to preserve some tyo traditional knowledge uh tyo dances and music um tyo beliefs and so on now we have a Resurgence the Resurgence is that we accept who we are as indigenous people it makes no sense for a nation such as ours to not be aware and not to know what has been done Generations past it isn't meant to be that we are to feel guilty about it but not to let it happen again if you look at the major transformations in human history and I
(20:07) don't care you know give me a list of a short list 5 8 10 12 I don't care how many you have to include in that list the unification of the old and new worlds into a single world after that everything is different from the way it was before people plants animals diseases ideas start moving all over the world in this sort of first great sweep of globalization a word that's much bandied about nowadays but the real globalization first occurs at the end of the 15th century in a sense they are the first people in the path of the
(20:49) hurricane and they deserve our our study and respect for that very reason [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
