(00:02) [Music] mabrica welcome to our taino culture series i'm priscilla colon co-founder and creative here casa de ito where mission is to promote the taino language and culture so today i have a compilation of our best of videos focusing on foods that changed the world now many of these food items may not have originated on our caribbean islands they were the result of thousands upon thousands of years of indigenous innovation however because we were the first culture and language of contact with europeans many of these foods that came from our
(00:53) islands were then spread around the world their names along with them so let's dive a little bit more deeply into the backgrounds of these foods their origins and then how they became part of the rest of the world but let's start first with some basic information about our daino ancestors fun fact it was written by the chroniclers that our taino ancestors ate between three and four meals a day but of course during an areato a ceremonial dance or celebration there would be a giant feast that would last for several
(01:34) days and during those feasts they would eat way late into the night you need to recover your calories after a lot of dancing right cows were not on the american continent so our indigenous ancestors didn't drink cow's milk and actually studies show that between 65 and 70 percent of all humans are lactose intolerant that means that they can't process milk it's even higher in asian and indigenous populations so if you are of taino descent it is very likely that you are lactose intolerant too in this case milk does not do the
(02:16) body good if you saw disney's encanto you're already familiar with the arepa a while ago you learned that arepa is a type of corn cake it is a traditional indigenous food that is still eaten today just a few weeks ago i had a delicious arepa at a local puerto rican tapas place the bread that our dino ancestors used to eat is casabe and that is a special bread made out of yucca yucca also known as maniac or cassava was the main crop of our taino ancestors to prepare the yucca you would first have to dig it up from underground
(03:06) yucca is a tuber it grows underground like a potato sweet potato and other root vegetables to prepare the yucca you first have to grate it then you have to squeeze the toxic juices out of it with something called a sibukan that is the yuka squeezer then they would grind up the yucca into the flour which makes casabe the yucca bread when the europeans first came to the caribbean it was the first time that they had encountered a pineapple in taino the word is ananas and this word may have actually come from the guarani word nana
(03:50) the guarani language is part of the tupian or tupi languages family and you see the topian languages occupy the pink area of this map you'll notice that the arawak languages occupy the blue area our people probably came in contact with each other so whether the word for pineapple ananas came from the arawak and then traveled to the guarani or whether it came from the guarani and then travel to the arawak we don't really know but we know that there probably was contact between our people which meant cultural exchange
(04:23) and actually in most of europe the word for pineapple is ananas when the europeans came it was the first time that they had ever had food that had been cooked on a platform over fire but referred to this process of cooking and in english it came to mean a lot of different things from the grill the event and even the sauce that you put on some meats the platform on which our taino ancestors cooked meats was called bucan it was a wooden platform you could call it the og of grylls well this word actually was borrowed and
(05:06) then a new word was created so did you know that the word buccaneer actually comes from the word bugan soon after the europeans arrived to the caribbean they began fighting amongst each other for land gold all kinds of stuff so the french pirates used to attack the spanish and then flee into the woods or the mountains where they learned how to use the bukan the spanish started calling the french pirates bucaneros which is like people who use the bukhan and by the way who did the buccaneers learn how to use the gun from
(05:41) our taino ancestors who taught them how to survive in the woods and in the mountains using the barbacoa process i don't know about you but i love chocolate and chocolate has such an interesting history so the original word for chocolate comes from the nawato word that is the language spoken by the aztec or meshika people of mesoamerica and the word choco-ato means bitter water from the now atoll it came into the spanish and it was transformed into chocolate and from there is where we get the taino chocolat archaeologists can trace chocolate all
(06:31) the way back to the olmec empire which occupied the area you see on the screen the maya also used chocolate and they occupied a very similar area the maya revered chocolate it was used in celebrations and they used to mix it with chili peppers and make a drink from it the aztec or mishika people also used chocolate and as you can see they occupied this area they also used to drink it hot or cold and mixed with a lot of chilies and other things and it was also the mishika currency it was thought to be more valuable than gold
(07:14) now did our taino ancestors have chocolate yes they did christopher columbus did come across chocolate and even took some back on his voyages to spain and so we can assume that chocolate got to the caribbean before the spanish were there and it makes sense because the maya coast is so close to our taino ancestors homelands now a staple food all around the world potatoes were first domesticated by indigenous peoples of southern peru about 10 000 years ago and it makes sense that peru alone would have more than 3 800 types or varieties
(08:05) of potatoes our dino ancestors grew potatoes as well because potatoes need a loose soil so that water drains they would create large mounds of dirt and then put the potatoes inside that way they could grow freely we started growing them a few years ago in a raised bed and it is so cool how easily you can get a bunch of potatoes so how did thainos contribute to the spread of potatoes around the world well they introduced the europeans to potatoes and even the word potato comes from the taino word batata or patata
(08:50) which is a very specific sweet potato so to honor our dino ancestors and continue their agricultural traditions you can plant your own potatoes the three sisters are a staple of indigenous america but where did these crops actually come from well most archaeologists can trace these crops back to mesoamerica that is the part that we know now as mexico and a lot of the countries in central america from there these crops moved up toward north america and down toward south america they were shared with indigenous groups
(09:36) in these areas who also took them and created their own varieties corn has such an interesting history scientists don't really know how humans created it but the indigenous americans were the first to create this it could even be that corn was the first genetically modified species by humans it was domesticated somewhere in the tewakan valley around 9000 or more years ago and it quickly became a feature in many indigenous gardens the word milpa in spanish which now refers to a sort of mexican garden actually comes from the word mee
(10:24) in nawato which means garden in the word konuko or kunuku is what was traditionally used but whether in a milpa or conoco the same sisters were grown together sometimes a fourth or fifth sister was added such as chiles or hot peppers now this type of gardening was not what europeans were used to seeing they were used to seeing neat rows of the same plant over and over again so when they came to the americas they thought the indigenous people didn't know how to plant they thought that these types of gardens were messy and just wild
(11:06) but the fact is that this type of gardening is actually the best way to grow plants the plants help each other grow bigger and better and you get more fruits and veggies so what happens when you plant these three sisters together let's begin with maisie or mahisi as it is known in daino that's where we get the word for maize or corn the maizi or corn grows first it has a very thin seed coat full of starch when the water hits it it triggers enzymes to turn that starch into sugars the sugars become a fuel for the embryo
(11:47) inside and then it starts growing a long strong stem what's really interesting is that the leaves that the corn grows don't sit on top of one another so each one gets sunlight next comes b2 the bean its seed swells with water and bursts and it sends a tiny root down into the ground but it's not going to grow a stem until the root is really secure and because it has so much energy inside the seed including its first leaves it doesn't need to grow stem right away it grows leaves first and then a long vine in a circle wrapping around the corn
(12:33) which at this point is already knee-high the last one to bloom is aoyama pumpkin it takes weeks for the first stems to poke out of the ground and leaves have to break out of the seed the pumpkin or squash extends herself along the ground away from the others it has wide umbrella-like leaves so why should you grow these three sisters together well they have a sense of reciprocity a give and a take so the first one corn does a very obvious job it supports the beans as they grow the beans have an interesting job they
(13:15) actually invite bacteria into their roots this bacteria turns the nitrogen gas in the air into the nitrogen that the plants need in the soil so really the beans are feeding all three sisters the pumpkin's job comes from one of its biggest features its leaves the big leaves help keep the soil moist so that it retains water and it keeps the weeds from growing because it provides shade in addition the little hairy parts of its leaves and vines stop caterpillars deer raccoons and other animals that might otherwise eat
(13:54) all the veggies the ahi is another word that comes from taino and it was incorporated into the spanish language ahi can be sweet or they can be hot and sometimes people use the word aji to mean hot peppers now the aji was used not only to season foods but it was actually used in what could possibly be the first recorded instance of chemical warfare so it was rated by the spanish chroniclers the tainos use a sort of capsaicin bomb a kind of smoke bomb made out of aji what would happen is they would take a pumpkin or calabash hollow it out put
(14:42) burning ashes and crushed ahi inside then they would take it throw it at the enemy and the enemy would obviously be like choking on the gas and they couldn't see it would get all in their eyes and that's when the tainos would come in covered up so they were protected from the smoke and then they would eat them over the head with macanas and hopefully like kill them off so don't believe the stories that are that you know ancestors were just so nice and so docile that they never even defended themselves that's absolutely
(15:19) not true well that's it for today i hope you enjoyed this video on all of the amazing contributions that our taino language and culture made to the foods that we eat today that are eaten by almost everyone around the world we should all be thankful to our indigenous ancestors for developing such amazing foods what would life be without barbecue potato chocolate and so much more want to teach the kiddos about taino foods check out our kids books especially a twisty vine where we learn more diana words for fruits and
(15:58) vegetables this is how we're gonna get the new generations to learn that you know too to continue the conversation you can follow us on facebook instagram and twitter in the meantime [Music] you
