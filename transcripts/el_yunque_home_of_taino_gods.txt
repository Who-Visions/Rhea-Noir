(00:02) Have you ever wondered what's the number one tourist attraction in Puerto Rico? Well, if you answered Fort San Felipe del Morro, in Old San Juan, you’d be absolutely right. But, if you answered Fort San Cristóbal, or Old San Juan as a whole, you’d be in the ballpark, but no Cracker Jacks for you. So what is number 2? Well, that’s a little more to the east.
(00:30) It’s El Yunque National Forest on the eastern end of Puerto Rico. It’s an attraction so old that it’s only 4 years younger than Yellowstone National Park,i  the oldest in the United States. Oh, and it’s the only tropical rain forest in the entire Nation. o that’s where we’re going today,  to El Yunque National Forest in the town of Río Grande, Puerto Rico.
(00:59) [music] Maybe you're wondering: “if El Yunque is so important, why have I ignored it for over 10 years, when I've covered every single town around it” ? In fact, I just looked at my records i and the last time that I posted anything about el Yunque on my blog “Puerto Rico By GPS” was on October 4, 2014. A year before that I posted a couple of videos on my YouTube channel bout “Fort San Felipe del Morro” and “Fort San Cristóbal”.
(01:50) Barrack Obama was serving his first term in office back then. So why the wait? Was I simply remiss? Well, not quite. You see, until January 6th of this yearii  you could be fined up to a quarter of a million dollars for filming in a U.S.National Park and posting it online. So, as you might imagine, I wasn’t going to risk getting in legal troublei  for doing something that's ultimately a promotion for the U.S. National Parks.
(02:25) Then, on January 6, Joe Biden signed H.R. 6492, better known as the EXPLORE Act, which once again makes it legal to film on federal land. Oh. and in case you’re wondering, there’s little chance that the present administration will reverse it, since it was a bi-partisan bill that had 100% approval on both sides.
(02:49) Believe me, those are really few and far between. So what is El Yunque National Forest anyway? It’s a 28,000 acre land reserve established in 1876 by King Alfonso XII of Spain, just four years after President Ulysses S. Grant established Yellowstone National Park in the great state of Wyoming. The park is located in eastern Puerto Rico between the municipalities of: Canóvanas, Río Grande, Luquillo, Fajardo, Ceiba, Naguabo, Las Piedras and Juncos.
(03:31) So how do you get the El Yunque National Forest? Well, if you’re coming from the San Juan, Condado or Isla Verde area your best bet is to take Road #26 (better known as the Román Baldorioty de Castro Expressway) going east, then State Road #3, once again going east,i  and get off at municipal Road #191 at the small village of Palmer in Río Grande.
(04:00) Some will argue that it's better to take Route 66 and follow it all the way to the town of Río Grande. But, I’ve tried them both, time and time again, and it takes just as long in both cases. Plus, Route 66 is a toll road and PR 3 isn’t. In any case, after you turn right at the entrance to Palmeri  it will take you about 10 minutes following PR 191 to reach the entrance to the park.
(04:29) You’ll see a large sign on your left hand side that reads: “El Yunque National Forest”. The forest is named after its second tallest peak “El Yunque” that resembles the shape of an anvil. And in case you’re wondering: yes a “yunque” is an “anvil” in Spanish. There are other tall peaks at El Yunque National Forest like “Pico del Este”, “Pico del Oeste”, “El Cacique” nd the tallest of them all: “El Toro”, which rises to 3,494 feet above sea level.
(05:06) That's more than twice as tall as Cadillac Mountain, the tallest peak on the eastern seaboard of the United States! El Yunque also receives lots and lots of water; almost 20 feet of it yearly. This makes for a jungle-like environment where rivers, waterfalls, ferns giant trees lush foliage and crags are commonplace.
(05:34) It is said that Puerto Rico’s Taíno nativesi thought of El Yunque as the throne of their chief god Yukahú. So that would make El Yunque National Forest the Caribbean equivalent of Mount Olympus in Greece. And guess what else El Yunque National Forest is great for? It’s the perfect place to get lost; and people do so on a regular basis.
(06:00) Thankfully, most of them are found. But others aren’t so lucky. So why am I telling you this? It’s not to discourage you! It's not to rain on your parade!!! Pardon the pun. Quite the opposite. It’s to encourage you to stick to the trails. After all, they’re there for a reason: to guide you in and out of the wilderness safely.
(06:27) Hey, maybe you’ll feel like I’m babying you. But it’s like the walls in Old San Juan. People are told every day not to walk on the walls. And yet, they walk, fall several storeys,i  break their legs —if they’re lucky— and ruin the holiday for them and their party. So don’t become a statistic. Stick to the trails.
(06:53) Their are many attractions to explore at El Yunque National Forest, yet —for many— the most appealing of them all is closed. It’s called “La Mina” and its a beautiful waterfall, about a half a mile down mountain,i  that has been inaccesible since Hurricane María hit the Island on September 20, 2017. But the fact is that the entire park is an attraction.
(07:20) Everywhere you look there's wildflowers, insects, rare plants, thousands of birds, water features, giant boulders,i   old growth trees… the list goes on and on.  And guess what you won’t find at El Yunque National Forest? There are no large predators, venomous snakes or spiders, large lizardsi  or dangerous vegetation of any kind.
(07:46) This doesn’t mean that there won’t be in the future, because irresponsible parties have brought boa constrictors, pythons, alligators and exotic birds to the Island, and the have all ended up in the wild. But those have mainly been caught in the western half of Island. So far, so good, at El Yunque National Forest.
(08:10) When you arrive at El Yunque National Forest you’ll find the visitor center on your right hand side. However, according to the park website the center is supposed to be open from 8:00am to 4:30pm, when in fact it opens at 9:00. And no, it wasn’t a daylight savings thing, because Puerto Rico doesn’t have that.
(08:34) In any case, I decided to visit the rest of the park and show you the visitor center later.  Little did I know that I’d have to pass on that too. But, more on that in a minute. There are various things that you’ll discover the minute you enter El Yunque National Forest. First, it’s unlike anything else you’ll find in the U.S. National Park System.
(08:58) The vegetation is denser, the temperature is hotter and the humidity is through the roof. But, did you know that El Yunque is not a National Park at all? It actually belongs to the United States Forest Service, which in turn belongs to the United States Department of Agriculture. Now, remember!  I’ve been visiting El Yunque since I was 16 years old.
(09:24) That was back in 1970. So, I saw it at its best, which is not what I found this time. Most of the trails are closed. So are the pullouts along road 191. That means that it’s close to impossible to find a legal parking spot. Meanwhile, local cops make easy prey of those that park along the road. And the rangers? Very well, thank you I got to the park at 8:30 in the morning, left close to 3:00 in the afternoon, and I didn’t see a single one all day long.
(10:03) And then there’s the visitor center.  I don’t mean to brag, but my wife and I have been to 22 U.S. National Parks so far, and over 50 State Parks, and I’ve never paid to enter a visitor center. Come to think of it, I’ve never paid to enter a National Park either, because I hold the “Senior Pass”. That entitles me and three guests to enter any facility belonging to The Forest Service, the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management, USACE, and Bureau of Reclamation.
(10:41) But not at El Yunque National Forest. The lady expected me to pay $4.00, and be grateful because I was getting a 50% discount. If I had brought three other guests (like the card allows me to) it would have been $16 altogether. Needles to say, I turned around and left the center. Now, here’s what I don’t understand.
(11:04) According to the attendant the card entitles me to enter the park, but not the visitor center. Have you ever heard of anything more bizarre? And just so you know, it wasn’t about the money. It was about the principle. I hate getting stiffed. As you pass the entrance to the visitor center the next thing you’ll find on your right is “La Coca Falls”.
(11:29) It’s a 85-foot fall that drops onto a massive black rock formation that sits at an elevation of 1,476 feet above sea level. And it’s right on the road, so you don’t even have to leave your car to see it, if you don’t want too. Maybe that was a good thing, since the parking area, that’s about 100 feet further up the road on your left hand side, was completely destroyed and being used by construction workers.
(11:59) Of course, everything I’m telling you is based on my research, my experience and my opinions, because there was nobody to ask anything and no written materials whatsoever. Right before “La Coca” they were building —what seems to be— a new gate area and fixing several places where road 191 has collapsed. A little further up the road you’ll find the Yokahú observation tower on your left hand side.
(12:46) On a clear day you can see all the way from the municipality of Río Grande to the town of Ceiba,i  including the island municipalities of Vieques and Culebra, and several smaller islands along the Fajardo coast. Looking south you can also see a substantial part of El Yunque National Rain Forest, as well as several of the peaks that make up the park.
(13:40) Of course, it would've been nice to have a ranger at hand to tell us which peak was which, but I guess they were all fired by the new administration. So, as luck would have it, I even had a chance to act as an impromptu ranger telling visitors about the park and the Island in general.   The tower is 69 feet tall, just short a foot to be 70, and has 98 steps to the top, just two steps shy of 100.
(14:11) I wonder if Dr. Frank Wadsworth designed it that way or if it was just by pure chance. You can see four kinds of forests from the top of Yokahú Tower: Colorado, Tabonuco, Palm and Cloud Forest. And, again, it would've been great to have a ranger around, because I certainly couldn't tell them apart. In any case, the views from Yokahú Tower are simply jaw droppers.
(14:42) But don’t believe me. Just climb it yourself and look at people’s faces. They tell the story all by themselves. Leaving the Yokahú Tower I drove about a minute up road 181 to a place that used to be my “little secret” when I was a young man. It’s called Juan Diego Falls and it’s not obvious from the road.
(15:07) It’s a two level fall that’s about 200 yards from the road. There’s a rustic trail, paved in rocks, that leads straight to the base of the falls. Oh, and it can get quite slippery when its wet. Next to the falls there’s a clearing where my friends and I would place lawn chairs, a cooler and a grill and spend the day.
(15:30) Well, our little secret is out. When I got there there were dozens of people bathing under the falls, shooting selfies and just hanging out under the tree canopy. And, as luck would have it, I once again ended up acting as an an impromptu ranger, as people started asking if there was a way to get to the second falls.
(15:54) I told them what I’m going to tell you. There’s a dangerous way and there’s more dangerous way. I guess that would be “dangerouser”. Nahhh… The dangerous way was how my friends and I used to do it.i  We used to tie a rope to one of the trees and walk across the top of the bottom falls.i  Then we would climb to the top falls.
(16:17) The “more dangerous” way is a trail on the right side of the bottom falls  that’s slipper even on good days. At my tender age of 70 there was no way I was going to try either way. I also made it clear that I didn’t recommend either one.  So I walked back to the road and drove to Baño Grande, a giant pool built in 1936 and closed in 1968 over safety concerns.
(16:47) The pool is 18-feet deep and is fed by the waters of the “La Mina River”, the same one that forms the famous “La Mina Falls”  about a mile down river. Today, “Baño Grande” is just a place to hang out, enjoy the environment and strike up a conversation, like I did  for over an hour (by the way) with a gentleman from Boston.
(17:11) And speaking about “La Mina” Falls, they’re closed (by the way) like I said before. hey’ve been closed sin September 20th, 2017, when hurricane María destroyed the entire area. People say that they’ll reopen sometime during 2025. But, once again, it would’ve been nice to have a ranger around to verify that information.
(17:34) As you walk up to the pool there's a trail that used to go all the way to the top of the mountain. There were 7 wooden “rest structures” where you could sit, catch your breath or simply get out of the rain.   Back then El Yunque was REALY a rain forest. It would pour almost every day. The peaks were constantly shrouded in clouds and the temperature dropped noticeably as you climbed to the top.
(18:03) I know because I climbed it dozens of times. But now, not so much.i  I guess climate change has reared its ugly head here too. How do I know? Because I can see the mountain from my home in San Juan and sometimes I can even make out the antenas on the mountain tops.  That’s way far from what it used to be. In any case, the trail was closed as well.
(18:30) So I went back to my car and headed for the Mount Britton Trail and Tower. Reaching the tower takes about 45 minutes in one directioni and, according to the park website, it’s a strenuous walk. So I guess I was lucky that there was no parking anywhere near the trailhead. Believe me. I went around twice. As I finished the second circuit I headed down the mountain.
(18:57) There were cars everywhere, parking nowhere, and cops preying on all those poor souls that parked by the road. It took me about 20 minutes to get off the mountain and park by the Mameyes river. The Mameyes river divides the town of Río Grande from the neighbouring town of Luquillo. As you’ll recall we’ve covered both towns on “Puerto Rico By GPS”.
(19:32) As I parked the car I flew the drone to get a grand view of the Luquillo Mountain Range,  that Includes El Yunque National Forest. By the time I put down the drone it was almost 3:00 in the afternoon so I headed for San Juan. And talking about San Juan, if you’re planning to visit the Old City, save yourself the hassle of traditional city tours.
(20:27) They’re expensive and you’ll be herded along with people that won’t necessarily share your interests.   Instead, order The Old San Juan Walking Tour. It’s packed with useful information about all the main attractions, It’s packed with useful information about all the main attractions, and two hours of exclusive online video.
(20:47) That way you’ll be able to —visit before you visit— and hit the ground running when you arrive in the Old City. See you next time!
