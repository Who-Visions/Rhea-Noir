(00:00) welcome to Voodoo within where race gender or political affiliation won't matter because we are all born with magic existence is Magic with the proper education you'll unlock your true potential ignorance cannot thrive in the light of consciousness welcome to active you go [Music] down thank you peace and blessings this is
(01:10) and we are back with another video today we're going to be talking about the energy alright so stay tuned and get this info as we break it down now when we look at Origins the original name of agawu in the Arawak time you know terminology is yukahu the god of the sky thunder and lightning okay again that was always used for crops now um let's look at the term itself when we break down ago as a term you first have the term AGA which coming from haga in Hebrew which means to speak or to growl okay when the heavens had spoken down to
(01:59) the wicked all right now let's look at the other side of the term which is now we know U is a war sound I'll give you an example was said like that that has been used for a very very long time since ancient times with African Warriors in modern day with the American Military when they're getting ready for war for battle you even have when a person gets punched they go oh because from the diaphragm then you also have even in football when somebody gets knocked out or just any sports really when you think about it
(02:31) the crowd will scream so all of it is there all of it um unifies with one another now let's now take a look at the power of the elements when we look at the origins of course all Origins date back to what nature so we look at nature let's look at the unification of the five elements where we talk about agawu as an energy form as it pertains to the strong nature okay now in the strong nature first off in the element we look at brain okay rain is what water we look at lightning that is fire we look at the wind that is air
(03:13) we look at earthquakes which of course that's the shaking of the earth we look at the Thunder which gives us the sound your five elements when you really look at it ago was a completion of all of the unifications of these elements to come and give you this very powerful spirit this very powerful energy it's all combining of Nature's elements now also when we take a look through ancient history and even into present day really since IET happens to be located in the middle of the Earth this is one of the areas that it can
(03:50) harness the energy better than pretty much anywhere else on Earth so it is a very sacred energy with the roots of this Arawak Taino base and where it's located has a lot to do with how the energy manifestes within that habitation [Music] now let's get into the characteristics of this powerful defense law now let's look at the colors the colors of agawu symbolizes the three different rights within Voodoo indigenous voodoo voodoo first off we look at the color white white is the Getty okay we know Gator are good for the communication Etc which
(04:32) also really represent Earth then you go into the red which is the pit wool meaning that fire that energy to push forward through everything and burn down things that need to be burnt now we also go into the blue light blue predict particularly which deals with the Gada energy okay the water the air as well okay now when we took take a look at the environment the environment things like mountains high up there energies that have anywhere with vegetation large amounts of vegetation you look at anything with large bodies of water like
(05:11) the ocean your Lakes your waterfalls the rivers Etc you look at all of those areas and of course trees Big Trees I.E energies like all of these areas are environments where this energy can habitate because again it's so tie-in with nature okay it's a manifestation of nature now let's go into the different kind of uh versions We want to say of agawa first off we have AGA utone means thunder in Haitian Creole of course now we also can look at agao exactly of the lightning okay of course thunder lightning now we go into agawu or as we
(05:56) really know it what it really should be okay agar sees the water okay or AGA of the water all right which deals again the water element that we talked about now we also have another one which is called Samsung now this energy I want to break down there's a lot going on here because this is when I got whose energy goes into beast mode it manifests itself in a physical form as a werewolf with wings okay in modern day that would be looked at as a gargoyle if you will but now when we go deeper into this um this would also be said as the term
(06:41) of lugawu okay in uh the Creole terminology now you look at the word is in the word so there you go now what all this means is that it's the energy truly of the shape-shifting okay shape shifting or also can also be called um de dubli basically means that this energy now is about to give its manifestation form that it needs to in order to do whatever it's come to do the work it has to do in this sense this actually appears more in the dream world okay energy we're talking about it's not so much more of a physical entity it's more
(07:22) an energy that comes in your dream world to mess up and attack the psyche okay when it attacks the psyche this is what causes Mass amounts of hallucinations okay now let me explain this a little more to you in IAT one of lugawu vole or flies if you will and the leak of radiation from the blue guy will fly because again this is one energy that's now merging to come into another dimension it's like dimensionals meaning if you will and the high level of radiation that that can cause people from the area when that energy is
(07:58) manifesting in that way can get what we call now the kutler basically just means getting an air or a leak of the radiation within the area which could be higher than what people are used to when that happens and even ancient times probably even until today what would end up happening is that they would have to take a hawk okay on malfini which means monfini by the way means the uh the evil or the bad energy of the bad always must end okay malafini which means finishing bad when that happens what ends up happening as ways to heal or to offset
(08:37) that energy because a lot of people used to think it was you know a negative thing or it could mean bad Omen because of course people could get sick from the league radiation as we spoke of what they would do a lot of times would be to burn the feathers okay to be able to use that in ritual to help with anybody that have taken on that um exposure but to go farther to keep that particular energy from coming near their area or their homes and in the in the travels that it would do would be to actually uh kill a
(09:09) hawk okay turn the whole upside down hang it up at the front of the door in order to make sure it could offset or to keep that kind of energy away okay now even to go farther if children ever got sick also from the leaking of the radiation Hawks would also be used to um bathe them so that you know the hawk would be passed around on them similar to what happens in rituals with like chickens you know a lot of times when the chicken's dead you're putting it everywhere to remove negative energy similar but in ancient times it was more
(09:43) the power of the hawk that would take place all right now if you look in modern day times as Things become of course more modernized right you can look at the dream catcher as a sense the dream catchers usually always have hawk feathers Along by other different little Trinkets and whatnot symbols and everything and it's also said to keep it at the door or close to where it is in your bedroom where you dream at of course I.
(10:10) E dream catcher now all of this comes from native and native Traditions so it all makes sense when you really look at it okay um also to even go a step farther when we go into some history I'ma bust the history on you real quick this energy was an energy that was activated very strongly during the Haitian revolution why because French soldiers would be afraid to sleep because they would bear the thought of seeing the torment dealing with this energy so basically hallucinations are taking place they feel like every time they go to sleep they're seeing this thing that's running
(10:52) after them flying over to come get them whatever the case and that would drive those spiritual psyche attacks to the point where either they were shooting their other Soldier comrades or even shooting themselves because they felt that's a way to get rid of what it was it's about driving you absolutely insane through the hallucinations so that's another function about how that energy when Agawam goes into the sun energy what can happen in the type of things that can take place all of it happens for most of the dream world to attack
(11:24) the psyche okay so to add to mention During the Revolution as well agawu wed glow different aspects of course when I go with low heat basically basically synced ships okay they couldn't reach to where they were going up with that you also had AGA Jose Claire which dealt with the lightning which of course was striking down them ships as well and destroying them at Sea you have the Raging of the wind going on at the same time helping and also the energy of that Thunder the Thunder that was going on made them fear
(11:57) made them know that God and divinely presence was there okay so all of these aspects contributed to the energy of winning the revolution I go and played a major role from the sea to the air back again okay when it came down to it and hallucinating the dream world and so both in the physical and in the dream worlds ago's energy was very very prevalent during the Revolutionary times so when we go into agawu's energy continuing on with the characteristics let's look at it from a standpoint of humans what type of energy is does that
(12:33) attract if you will well first off you you have to have this pure character it has to be more of an energy of Innocence being pure in heart because remember there's a very serious Angelic Godly presence when you think of the energy of pagawu so basically to deal with an energy like ago one must be whether it be whatever the case may be that has to be a very strong leader an energy that has mastered the elements we're talking about on the Airbender type level here okay one energy I can give you an example of would be vigzama his ultimate
(13:10) Act of sacrifice was something that let you know that he went above and beyond and mastered all that there needed to be in a sense to be able to sacrifice himself with the greater good of humanity okay for ages and generations to come that's one aspect Also let's take a look at an example of things that kind of give you indications first off if someone really is truly connected for example if they're upset then all of a sudden it just starts raining a lot real heavy you know what I mean Thunder starts all of a sudden you know that's a
(13:41) raw form of that energy expressing itself all right and you know sometimes again too a person could be walking somewhere or they just tend to get somewhere and then rain always follows them if you will okay if that's another huge sign as well you also have the fact that in extreme aggression when there's a lot of anger and a lot of forceful energy going on lightning will strike you know what I mean in accompanying with the Thunder it'll be a whole vibe sometimes the wind also will pick up in the area where person may be
(14:11) maybe so when a person carries around an innocent energy and they happen to also live within the habitation and the environment of styles this is where you can see where agao can more so come in and express itself the the Lua can express itself all right now um I want to go into the whole function of this whole you know church and Saint image um that deals with the whole Sammy shell Archangel function now the reason I'm mentioning this because when in Haitian Voodoo as we know a lot of it still has very heavy presence with this Catholic
(14:49) image um you know of How It's been done for quite some time solely but surely this is changing so Okay the reason why it's important is because you'll usually see that when they put the pictures of the images one next to the other you will mostly see the energy of bound criminal you'll see the energy of lenglassu and you will see the energy of agawu okay now in biblical reference let me break it down this is the thing these luas when they come together basically a Vengeance okay and I'm gonna give you now in a Biblical reference how they
(15:25) even show it to you Pete game so first off in the whole story with Jesus right Jesus is basically condemned instead of them choose using Jesus to be the man that was innocent they chose barabus who was a rapist okay so basically the court system or the system of people okay with their hate in their hearts Etc betrayed him okay his system failed him so you know he became what criminalized and becoming criminalized this is where the bound criminal energy got activated okay now when you go deeper into the story what happened they
(16:01) pinned him on a cross to be killed and pitting him on the cross of course by the time they did that the next thing that took place was what he was stabbed in the heart at the cross that right there is giving you the language Sue function because of the blood the stabbing of the heart the um betrayal that begotten from it and again energy of Vengeance now because this energy no longer has its innocence things now now have changed because it's been unjustly dealt with another aspect to really seal it is when we're going to agaw
(16:35) because he was killed at the cross the cross serves as what we call an antenna the antenna has been for eons a way that conducting of lightning can hit okay so when you take a look even in modern day with churches and Cathedrals from ancient times all the way up until now if you ever pay attention there's always gonna be that antenna at the top to harness that kind of energy okay so again this is how they became a lot and energy of Vengeance if you will okay so him dying at the cross the way he died with using the cross as even a
(17:16) way to stake him up there and then towards the end agawu's energy deals with what it's like a god-like Angelic form of energy so guess what then all of a sudden they tell you God was upset and mad at what Humanity had done with the Innocence impurity he sent down to help them what happened Sky opens up the Heavens opens up the Roaring the Raging the wind the Thunder the lightning the Earth shaking probably even we're talking about the whole embodiment of agawu takes place from that action so basic is a beautiful story to pretty
(17:53) much show you how his energy or the energy period the law can manifest itself okay the unification once again of the elements now let me explain really quickly when I say the word or term escort so you understand escorts is basically a chain of energy where if one law shows up one energy shows up it causes a chain reaction for others to energy to come in and follow alright so again hence what you get the chain reaction energy from now to top it off I want to show you another aspect also of agawu agawu also has another side okay
(18:29) which that is the side when it's being run and governed by the Sea now his escorts okay if you want to even call them friends in a sense that will come along when he's in that format or in that format would be uh agui you would have the energy of simbi the Sim bees all together symbi's are very vast as well you'd have the energy of super you have the energy of bad day you have all of that energy present when the water is involved the ocean is involved and we just discussed that why because again ships the lightning is hitting water the
(19:05) water is Raging the wind is going the Thunder is going it's a whole event to make sure whatever has to happen is gonna happen and what's not supposed to happen won't happen either so again all of the energy one with the passage of the sea all right ago then goes into being that character or that energy so there are two different sides to the agawu energy okay and I'm gonna also explain this to you as well this energy is an energy that mounts people and many say is very well when it rarely does I should say when it does
(19:39) happen people or whoever and however the Schwab usually are very afraid and fear and tell you that it's violent for this main reason the fact of the matter is that most of the time if and when this ever does happen for uh you know the possession to take place that energy will come so loud that the voice will become mute after The Possession meaning the voices sold out there is no voice to now where that particular person's body that was used to swallow it becomes mute and if that Schwan was doing things that were not
(20:16) proper before such then of course they can be repercussions where sometimes a life may be taken or there can be sickness that happens for a certain amount of days from again the forceful powerful energy we're talking about god-like energy here people we're talking about Angelic energy we talk about strong powerful nature forces here okay defense law type of energy it's not to be messed with so a lot of times in one you see mumbles and organz always tell you they fear this energy they don't want to call this energy it's not energy
(20:48) anybody should call either we're going to talk about them but we don't know if we're gonna actually deal deal with him there is a reason behind it is because many people fear that you don't want to be the one that will be without a voice or even at times even without a life if you will by wrongdoons previous if they've been naughty business going on or impurities going on with how business has been handled okay with others all right innocent people that they bring to them for whatever then yeah repercussions definitely can take place
(21:18) so let's not forget that most UGA and Mambo do not want to call on this energy or they can't really because they don't want to mess up their adaptation their spiritual house the thing is a lot of times in real time as we speak many ugas and mambles are dealing dirty and Shady out here in these spiritual streets what I mean by that is for example turning families against one another being paid to say this one is doing something when reality is not even true or naming names to pick them against each other you know
(21:48) for example sending money over and accepting the money to kill an innocent child just because that child may be due to something or ownership or something so they want them out of the picture okay turning brothers and sisters against one another for who got what in the family we talking about scamming people saying they're gonna do one thing and do another saying they're gonna give them you know spiritual abilities or help them within their spiritual journey even and then really don't end up doing a damn thing but actually trying to take
(22:17) away from the person's Essence and energy instead of help them so there are so many different things we're talking about when women go and say Hey I want to break this family up because I want this dude to be mine you know doing that domination type of love work thinking that's what's going to help them when really it's just a facade but instead of turning that kind of thing away and trying to really be righteous okay within the works what they do is the complete opposite they put the money over the morality and this is the reason
(22:45) why they so scared to call on the homie I know because I'm gonna be the mess around and they trying to call that energy and cause a flood up in a whole area just make their whole thing go down down the hill okay have the wind going the rain pouring we talking about lightning hitting fools their cars or even them themselves because of the dishonesty okay because of the scamming because of the lack of Integrity all right to not only the Lua but you dang on sure not to come coming stupid with because again we said this is Godly
(23:22) energy we're talking about here we took my nature in its purest form unified all right so yeah this is a big reason and so also again as I said when you see that those that do if that ever does happen the Rarity of if it does happen go quiet or Go mute again this is where the whole thing about being feared being feel that the energy is violent being feelings like yo don't mess with this energy because again most is not living right they have not mastered their elements they have not done their Airbender work if you will and they
(23:56) operate not of a place of grief need and not integrity so when we look into pop culture of course you know there are movies and all kinds of stuff one of the big ones of course is the movie that deals with Thor okay we talking about the energy of Zeus uh Slash Odin if you will that gives you the whole energy has the ability to shape-shift into a hawk we already talked about that Hawk energy that hero energy but also the fact that the hawk is a big representation of agawu and flight all right so of course that
(24:35) energy of Zeus what does it have it comes as the God and it has the Thunder and the lightning and all these things that constitute Our God's energy you also have in Egypt when you look at the four sons of Hebrew it's actually representation of the four elements we know that they're five as well but just in the four main and sound encompasses all of it now also of course we talked about that as well with Sammy shell and the whole energy of the Archangel with the sword in the left hand and the pose a certain way to be able to say it's
(25:06) killing off the devil it's killing off the evil in that whole thing of course we know time and time again in the Bible God has always seen us he's going to give you the wrath of God with nothing but the Thunder the lightning striking the Earth shaking the wind blowing and all of that stuff in compassion between when we go into uh Thor of course we know oh and allies God and Asgard even has the agar in there as well and of course that Pantheon tells you all about that the Thunders the lightning comes in the form of ready to go and God is and
(25:41) Zeus is the one giving us its power to be able to go on and do what he does in store so yeah it keeps going on and on also in the video game A Beautiful video game I actually really love which is called God of War okay aka the god of Vengeance Kratos deals and retrains all of his elements throughout the video game he had all the elements by the time it was said and done which is our fire the Sorting the lightning the thunder coming in when he the wind blown and the whole nine so all of the expressions of it come together where again he's coming
(26:14) to deal with the Vengeance aspect of things but means the elements together in order to reach his destination and get it done so all in all pop culture everywhere we go okay nature is abundant and it is around us at all times so we can never forget that really when we look at agawa we really are looking at the essence of nature itself okay in a very powerful way though in a very strong aggressive and um symbolic kind of way okay so while still in pop culture one of the things I wanted you to attention to is in the season of
(26:52) Easter in IET one of the cool things that always used to go down was that kites used to be put up in representation of the season if you will of Eastern children at play and things of that nature however income Catholicism that's what it shows but on the other side those that dealt with Voodoo if you know you know you understand what I'm saying also it was a time where heavy season of travel would happen at Sea because of all the wind that was able to push through Etc now another thing I want you to take a look
(27:23) at and observe is that in Catholicism sadly the mixture has been done so much they would tell you during Easter to cover with a white cloth your Voodoo tables and not to impartaken anything with that and whatnot but it's because they know it's such an important time where you actually should be working your magic that they reverse it and make you think not to so that they can harness all the energy for themselves because they surely do what Their masses their Church events their everything goes down what they want you know the
(27:55) other side not to do it if you will but it's just interesting how that takes place as well and then even when we go into a very famous song for this agawu energy it's so real to what we talked about earlier in the energy of marbles and oogens and all of the crazy stuff going on with um you know no no truthfulness in it and money over morality that the song says that there's no more good law and that the those those who are the no more good lies basically again like a uh how can we say Proverbs they're saying there's
(28:29) no more good people because if those people are the ones saying that they have a wa but then they're doing all of these nasty Shady things then sheesh there must not be any more good why if you will in that regard and basically all that they're doing is serving up for politic okay politicking of their pockets if you will so there's the famous song that a lot of the voodoo know a lot of people really will know and actually I'll even post it um down so you get a Vibe with the image of that music but honestly in the end it really
(28:57) says that and it's you know it's really talking from a candid place if you will you know what I mean so at the end of the day the energy of I got one really does deal with heavy amount of Truth and rights and Justice yes it does make you think of the OBU energy but we told you the tie on that anyway of that Hebrew slash you know different manifestations of it foreign of my personal experience in personal experience basically when I have dreams I saw myself flying a lot having that real bird-like Airbound energy so I know
(29:37) that that was the presence of him also when um the energy happened and the root house had gotten damaged and things happened to the root house way back when we ended up going there and when we were installing and placing the law in the set areas of the new place had been built it was so deep that you know there was a lot of rain there was a lot of wind there was even Sun that it was like so and we knew that that was that ago energy presenting itself as well even inside when we're actually putting up certain images and different things in
(30:08) there water okay we're talking on a hot day water came in not seeping in from a a leak but water from the wall itself came out in kind of this sense of Purity or this sense of letting us know the element was very strong and with us also we also did a whole other Vibe with um visiting some other oogums right within the area and during the time frame we had to go and talk to them and deal with different things when the spirit came through on one of these ugong they basically told us that all of the rain that was going on from us
(30:42) leaving when we were at our Temple to get to over where we were going was them giving us a sign of honoring and they called that ushan so an honoring element to salute us if you will and let us know that they were happy that we were coming they were happy that we were in the area doing what we were doing so all in all I know the agawa energy is very strong it's powerful the energy is serious and it is a very natural but yet strong and powerful type of vibration with that said at Kai P4 we will definitely be
(31:18) having a service to honor this great powerful energy and the details will definitely be below in the description box so definitely make sure that you subscribe make sure that you are um getting in where you fit in with that and if there's any other details of course everything will be in the detailed description box peace and blessings until a next video of the Loa I eat and all of the different elements that are within it
