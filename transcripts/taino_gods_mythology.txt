(00:00) Taino religion and creation myths throughout  the Caribbean can vary and at times can   be confusing and contradictory    depending of where they come from. The Taino creation myth in and of Puerto  Rico is a variation of these general Taino   myths throughout the Caribbean. It focuses on the  role of Yúcahu, the supreme deity of the Taino.
(00:25) According to the myth, Yúcahu lived in the  peak of El Yunque, a mountain in Puerto Rico   that was considered sacred by the Tainos.  He was a benevolent and generous god who   gave life and abundance to his people.  He also had a a brother named Juracán,   who was the god of chaos or disorder.
(00:50) Juracán  was jealous of Yúcahu's power and goodness,   and often tried to destroy his  creations with his winds and rains. One day, Juracán sent a giant cayman (a type of  crocodile) to attack Yúcahu's mountain. The cayman   bit off a piece of the mountain and swallowed it,  along with Yúcahu's magic duho (a wooden stool).   This caused Yúcahu to lose his strength and  fall ill.
(01:22) As a result of this, the Taino noticed   that their crops were failing and their fish were  disappearing, and they prayed to Yúcahu for help. Guabonito, heard their prayers and came to  Yucahu's rescue. She was a powerful healer who   knew the secrets of plants and herbs. She found  out that Juracán was behind Yúcahu's sickness,   and she decided to trick him.
(01:48) She  pretended to be a beautiful woman   who wanted to marry him. She asked him to  show her his treasures. Juracán agreed,   and he took her to his cave where he kept  the cayman that had swallowed Yúcahu's   duho. Guabonito saw the duho inside the  cayman's belly, and she used her magic to   make it come out. She then returned the duho  to Yúcahu, who recovered his health and power.
(02:17) Yúcahu was grateful to Guabonito for saving  him, and he rewarded her with a gift. He gave   her a piece of land that he had carved  out of his mountain with his hands. This   land became known as Borikén, which means  "the great land of the valiant and noble   lord" in Taino language.
(02:44) Yúcahu blessed  Borikén with fertile soil, abundant water,   and diverse flora and fauna. He also made it his  favorite place to visit to watch over his people. This is the creation story that gave the  Taino in Puerto Rico an explanation of   how Borinken came to be in order for them to  make sense of their existence on that land. The Taino in Puerto Rico and the  Caribbean were in general what   we call polytheisists.
(03:14) They believed  in a series of major Gods and lesser   Gods who exerted complete control of  everything happening to and around them. For most, Yucaho is mentioned as the supreme  Taino God, however, the first Taino creation myth   speaks of the powerful creator god called Yaya,  considered the supreme being of the universe. As the life-giving spirit and causal force  of creation that presides over the universe,   Yaya plays multiple functions in the mythology,  as supreme being, cacique, and father.
(03:52) In fact,   Yaya is actually believed by many to have  become Yucaho. As a result of this Yucaho is   thus seen as the supreme being in Antillean  mythology. He lives in the sky and is the   invincible and beneficial protector of man.  He is also the god of Yuca who fertilizes   the Earth and multiplies the harvests. For  the Taino, Yuca or Cassava is a sacred food.
(04:24) Another important deity in Taino  mythology is Yuhacu's mother, Atabey,   the goddess of fresh water, fertility,  and the moon. She was also called the   Mother of Waters or the Mother  Earth. Of exceptional beauty,   she taught men of the spirits that control  the beings of the invisible world.
(04:48) The Taino   would pass her representations over the belly of  the women in labor in order to calm their pain. Another important female deity is Guabanex.  She is the goddess of hurricanes, storms,   and winds. She was also called the Furious One  or the Old Woman of the Winds. This deity was   a reminder to the Taino people when they went  astray or failed to give offerings to the Gods.
(05:19) Then there's Juracan, who sought to undermine  his brother Yucahu.  He is the  god of chaos,   disorder, and evil. He was also called  the Destroyer or the One Who Causes   Destruction. He was believed to  be the source of all hurricanes   and natural disasters. This is one of  the Gods that the Taino do not honor.
(05:43) Other Gods included: Maketaori Guayaba, the god of the dead, the  underworld, and the night. He was believed to   be the ruler of Coaybay, the land of the dead,  where the souls of humans went after death. There was Boinayel, The god of rain, clouds,   and drought. He was also called  the Rain Giver or the Good One.
(06:09) And Marohu, The god of sunshine, clear skies, and  dry weather who was also called the Sun Giver. The list of Taino Gods is numerous and  the forces that these deities represented    gives us an understanding of what was  important and crucial in their lives. The Taino were super religious and every aspect  of their existence was believed to be explained   or controlled by multiple deities and so they  were very adamant in pleasing these powers.
(06:45) They expressed their devotion to the Gods or  spirits by making carved representations of them,   usually from wood, stone, or bone. These  carvings were called zemi idols. The Taino   placed these idols in temples, shrines,  or houses, and offered them food, tobacco,   or blood. The Taino also wore zemi amulets  around their necks or arms for protection.
(07:15) They also had special ceremonies to honor  the zemis and ask for their blessings. These   ceremonies involved dancing, singing, drumming,  and sometimes vomiting to purify themselves. In   addition, the Taino had a sacred bread made from  cassava or Yucca that they shared with the zemis   and each other.
(07:44) They believed that eating this  bread would give them the power of the zemis The Taino's social structure was also  influenced by their religion. They had   a hierarchy of chiefs and subchiefs who were  believed to be descendants of the zemis. They   also respected their elders and ancestors, and  buried them with their belongings and zemi idols. The Taino religion was largely destroyed by the  Spanish conquest in the late 15th and early 16th   centuries.
(08:15) The Spanish enslaved, killed,  or converted most of the Taino population,   and burned their temples and idols.  Some of the Taino who survived mixed   with other groups and preserved some  aspects of their culture and religion.
