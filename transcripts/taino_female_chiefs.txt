(00:54) to promote Theo language and culture now as I started to prepare this presentation I realized that I needed to take a huge step back and really think about what decolonization actually means because you see decolonizing is not something that happens outside of ourselves true decolonization happens in our minds and bodies allowing our souls to be free of these self-imposed shackles so before we talk about Dino female Chiefs we must first look at how deeply ingrained our own biases are against females in leadership positions
(01:33) let's take a look at some of the stories that we've heard about women take a close look at this painting who is the woman in the picture what is the story you've heard about her well if you grew up in any judeo-christian household you know that the woman in the picture is Eve from the Garden of Eden and she's often the subject of very negative portrayals I was curious to know what Chad GPT knows about Eve and the results are not surprising unfortunately the adjectives that chat GPT used to describe Eve included
(02:12) temptress seductress deceptive weak gullible disobedient rebellious the source of original sin now what do these adjectives say about our mother so supposedly the woman we all come from what do they say about women in general would these be the kinds of characteristics you would want to see in a leader but the story of Eve is just that a story let's take a look at another painting does anyone know who this woman is well let me tell you who she is this is skyw skyw woman is from the hodon or iroy origin stories when I asked chatu to describe
(03:06) skyw woman it talked about the interconnectedness of Nature and Humanity balance and nurturing and the adjectives that it used to describe skyw woman sacred Creator transformative nurturing harmonious wise resilient generous and the source of life now I want to introduce you to the mother of creation Ino origin stories this is a painting of her created by Tao bik or spiritual leader Miguel sag Jr atab also known as atabex or Ates or ataba is the central figure Ino cosmology atab is the feminine aspect of Yaya great Spirit and the words used to
(04:02) describe her include sacred feminine mother of creation protector of life nurturing the being of fertility she governs the waters she is a Healer she is divine Authority but she also has a dual nature because you see ad is not just the Creator when things aren't going right she will come in and sweep everything away with the Hurricanes to ensure that new life grows in a better way so she's got that dual nature which means she is in harmony with everything everything is IM balance now imagine what kind of leader would atab make she'd probably be
(04:52) one that is very diplomatic because she would understand all sides so what happened in 1492 one of my favorite quotes comes from braiding sweet grass by Robin wall kimmerer and then they met The Offspring of skyw woman in this case atab and the children of Eve and the land around us Bears the scars of that meeting The Echoes of our stories so we're talking about a clash of World Views that spans thousands of years back to our origin stories and the repercussions are unimaginable so who were the children of atab we need to establish the context of
(05:36) who the Taos were before pre-colonization for a couple of reasons most people have never heard of dinos because they were the first people of contact in 1492 they experienced the brunt of colonization the onslaught and brutality also the Spanish declared the dinos extinct around the mid to late 1500s so in the eyes of the LW because OS don't exist those who have heard of tyos believe only the colonizers perspectives what they left in their documents which is that dinos were naive docile like children that they just romed around the
(06:17) tropical forests half naked and so that in Columbus's own words they would make good slaves modern Dayo academics are using an interdisciplinary approach to find out what Dino Society was actually like what if we could apply the same methods to explore our female ancestors in 1975 Puerto Rican historian Haled badio tried to do the same he published the indigenous woman and her Society coincidentally 1975 was also declared by the UN International women's year he highlighted the connection with all indigenous people in Abella the mature
(07:02) land he wanted to establish the fact that we are all connected and he used historical and contemporary evidence of his time to prove not only women's roles in Dino Society but also women's roles as Chiefs he began by asking the question were female leaders common and the answer is yes especially in matenal Societies in these societies people trace their families through their maternal lines these societies are organized into Clans which are groups of related families the husband usually joins his wife's Clan and the children
(07:43) belong to the mother's Clan and the clan leaders are none other than the grandmothers among the Sena and Tuscarora of North America they have an origin story where their first Chief was a woman in modern day Colombia and Venezuela you have indigenous people who also historically had many female Chiefs before and after colonization historian Hal suo was able to uncover the names of 36 female Chiefs on the island of II shared by hati in the Dominican Republic from a 1514 distribution of Santo Domingo now you see under the horrific enoma system Dino
(08:26) lands and the peoples themselves were distributed among among the Spaniards who became their new owners this list of distribution shows the female Chiefs and their thos their family members who they oversaw now we don't know if this was a complete list for that year we don't know how many female Chiefs would have existed before the Spanish began documenting them however this list stands as a testament that female Chiefs existed in bin modern day Puerto Rico the historian uncovered the names of 13 female Chiefs gathering this list was no
(09:07) easy task he had to dig through legal documents where many female Chiefs are mentioned offhand in passing mostly these legal documents were disputes between the Spaniards who wanted to claim ownership of the dinos and in some cases as we will soon see their names were deliberately erased because they were female leaders but for years later in 1979 archaeologist Ricardo alria was quoted as saying there's no definitive evidence that before the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors there were women carrying out the functions of chiefs
(09:45) it's possible that the Spanish imposed their hereditary Concepts on the indigenous society and called the principal women of the dino leaders gika AKA female Chief and that upon the chief's death the Spanish then elevated his widow or principal wife to the office of Chief but who was Ricardo alria well he happens to have been the father of modern-day Puerto Rican archaeology he was the first director of The Institute of Puerto Rican culture and his words carried a lot of weight so that's where the debate began however he
(10:23) was ignoring all of the historical and contemporary evidence of his time because of Ricardo alegria's work words by the early 1980s people began to question whether Dino women had been Chiefs before colonization they said that this was the idea that came from Hardcore feminists of the 60s and 70s and they said that it was the Spanish not dinos who made women Chiefs as a way to control Dino Society the subtext is that Dino women were gullible weak and easily controlled women were the downfall of the entire Theo Society does that story
(11:06) seem Familiar of course that's the story of Eve it's incredibly familiar to our people because one of the first things imposed by the Spanish was Catholicism as a way to erase our beliefs our history and our stories but what if it's not just the stories that colonize our minds what if it's the very language that is being used that's the real weapon one of my favorite quotes comes from the sci-fi film arrival language is the foundation of civilization it is the glue that holds a people together it is the first weapon drawn in
(11:45) conflict and new research is bearing this out Spanish and German speakers were asked to describe a bridge Spanish speakers use words like long and strong while German speakers use words like beautiful and elegant why would they use such different words to describe the same object well Spanish and German are gendered languages so the Spanish speakers view bridge as a male or masculine words so their adjectives were quote unquote masculine while the German speakers view bridge as a feminine or female word so they use quote unquote
(12:25) feminine adjectives to describe the same bridge in fact this happened when Spanish imposed their gender Norms through the Spanish language so let's take a look at a few words that were from the dino language that became gendered when they were integrated or translated into Spanish Yaya for example means the great spirit but when it was translated into Spanish it became El acquiring that masculine gender bik which is Shaman spiritual leader or healer became El again acquiring that masculine gender and gik chief became
(13:11) elik again acquiring a masculine gender so in this way it became ingrained into the public Consciousness if you spoke Spanish that gik bik and Yaya are either all males or roles associated with men which is actually not true because these words were gender neutral in the original Tao language but Ricardo alria was right about one thing the Spanish created the word laaa referring to a female Chief as a way to integrate a concept that didn't exist in their world viw it was obvious that female chiefs were not an unusual phenomenon it
(13:53) required new language but what does the word kasik actually mean when we break down this word into three parts we believe that it means the head point or leader of the land and we have evidence from indigenous relatives in the arak language of Guyana there are three words that are very similar to kasik kasan means to have a home to be the owner of a home to be the head of a household and Kashi quali for males and kashik qu for females means the owner of a home the person who occupies a home and is the head of a
(14:39) household last year I had the pleasure of meeting Dr Antonio kuret the curator of the Smithsonian Museum of the American Indian in Washington DC and he's been working for 20 years to answer one question do we really understand what gik means he's been conducting research at the thas indigenous ceremonial Center trying to find out who was the kasik for example was there somebody who owned more land who had a bigger house who had more beautiful adornments but everything that he's found so far has pointed to one thing
(15:21) that dinos were an egalitarian society based on kinship systems with a casik or head of household so what happened when Aro ancestors faced these new people who arrived to their Shores with a very different idea of how Society should function their responses and approaches changed as circumstances changed for both men and female leaders today I want to share with you the stories of three Dino female Chiefs who I'm dubbing the lover the Diplomat and the warrior due to the three different approaches they took to deal
(15:59) with the Spanish Invasion but the intention behind their actions was the same saving their people let's begin with the lover kasik OA I call her this for the way in which she welcomed Spaniards her yukay or Village was where modern day Santo Domingo the capital of the Dominican Republic is and there is no coincidence Santo Domingo was placed on top of her yukay her Village we first hear about casik OA from the chronicler Gonzalo Fernandez de oo and this comes from around 1495 fleeing from laaba they went up the
(16:42) coast until they arrived where the city of Santo Domingo is currently situated and they stopped in this settlement because they found an Indian village Miguel Dias became friends with the chief who was later renamed katalina and in time they had two children you see Miguel Diaz had gotten into a fight with another Spaniard badly injuring him and the Spanish were not happy he was fleeing from his own people as he's fleeing he happens to run into a tho Village led by kasik OA she took in The Fugitive Spaniard Miguel Diaz now some
(17:21) of you might be thinking how could she she's a traitor she took in this Spaniard well first AR ancestors had no idea who the Spaniards were what was coming and remember their entire Society was built on relationships kinship systems if a neighbor comes to you asking to borrow a cup of sugar or for help you don't greet them with a volley of arrows kasik OA was not the only one dubbed as a quote unquote lover famously kasik of Boren Puerto Rico was known to have had a relationship with a black black Conquistador and because of these
(18:01) relationships these women have been painted with a broad brush saying that they were weak or gullible or coerced but when we do that we deny them their own agency they made choices based on the information they had at the time just like all of us would have let's turn now to the Diplomat kasik anak GAA kasik anaka is probably one of the most famous Dino Chiefs whether male or female she was born in yaguana the capital of haraga which is present day leoon Haiti around 1474 she was a great poet composing many of the songs and stories for the
(18:42) ceremonies called arito gasik anaka was from the matrilineal chief's line of haraga she married kaabo chief of maguana essentially uniting these two families now there is a story that is conveniently left out of the public narrative because it doesn't align with the perspective of dinos as a docile people after Columbus crash landed on the island of I he realized they had wrecked the Santa Maria he left a contingent of 39 men while he sailed back to Spain these men began pillaging and raping tho women GA Abul and his
(19:21) Fighters slaughtered them when Columbus came back all the Spaniards were dead and their settlement lavidad had been burned to the ground you can imagine that GAA became Enemy Number One GAA was arrested in 1494 and died in 1496 at that point kasik anaka became advisor to her brother boy Chio who established a relative peace with the Spaniards and in 1500 anaka became chief of haraga and principal chief of the island now this relative piece lasted about 6 years but in 15 1903 the Spanish governor Nicolas dando said he had heard
(20:03) rumors of AO Revolt let's hear what bom lasca says about the massacre of 1503 the governor arrived one day with 60 men on Horseback and more than 300 infantrymen and through treachery he convinced more than 300 Lords to enter a large house made of straw once inside he ordered the place set on fire and they were burned alive all the others as well as an infinite number of people were run through with swords and as an honor the great lady anaka was hanged now was anaka a fool for inviting the Spanish for peace talks no she had no reason not
(20:47) to trust them after six years of relative peace and she wasn't the only gasik to try to establish alliances with the Spaniards kasik auana the first a male chief famously established an alliance with the Spaniards when they first arrived in borin he participated in a guo ceremony with Bon De Leon who would later become the Spanish governor this was a ceremony of friendship or Brotherhood due to her amazing strength of character today anaka is memorialized through statues books movies songs and so much more her spirit of diplomacy
(21:28) lives on now let's learn about the warrior kasik guerbas kasik guerbas has the distinction of having her name almost completely erased from history she is from the region of OTA called UT today and it is located in the center of the island of Boren Puerto Rico by the early 1500s the dino people of bdikin were fed up with the Spanish you see the Diplomatic alliances between the OS and the Spanish had crumbled now auan thei the original AG's brother who had taken over as gik or chief United many of the families and declared war against the
(22:12) Spaniards the Spanish Dina War lasted almost two decades and kasik gueras was a key participant in this war her Fighters were associated with the burning of kapara the first Spanish capital of borin now the dino Chiefs who part participated in this war were tracked and captured and we hear about kasik gueras from one of the chroniclers who stated they captured alive 16 great Lords and one great lady by the name of gueras the historian Hal SW badio believes that her name was systematically erased from history and
(22:49) then later her gender was changed when I asked Chad to tell me about kasik gueras Chad G said that she was a male Chief now because we only have one version of a story one perspective usually the colonizers we're training all of our technology to only have that story we need to start correcting those mistakes we need to start sharing all of the stories a few years ago I heard a powerful speech by Nigerian writer chimamanda adichi who talks about the danger of a single story how it leads to dehumanizing people to perpetuating
(23:30) stereotypes to denying them their voice and their agency but she also stated when we reject the single story when we realize that there is never a single story about any place and I would add or any people we regain a kind of paradise and that is my goal today by sharing these women's stories though incomplete as they may be we can begin to see their full Humanity the complexity of women in all of our forms these women embodied that complexity in the way they Liv their lives in the relationships they built in the choices they made to
(24:09) bravely face a world that was rapidly changing around them they were lovers and mothers sisters and strategists Warriors and ambassadors all of the things that the great mothers of our Origins were and more as we come to the end of this presentation I want you to share the stories that you've heard about these women today because by sharing their stories we're going to start busting many of the myths that come to us from a colonizer perspective so many which have been ingrained in our subconscious which have actually been
(24:43) helping to keep us colonized by sharing these stories we're going to be decolonizing our minds we're going to start healing so many of the wounds within our community by sharing these stories you'll be able to heal something deep within yourself something deep within a friend or a family member but most important of all you're going to help heal the future Generations in the meantime thank you to our sponsor the legend of the kasik princess by Michael doraa pick up your copy today and reconnect with the rich Legacy of our
