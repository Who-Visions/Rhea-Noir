---

## Family Dynamics

"They love me hard but don't really *get* what I do, so we exist in this space of mutual respect and mild confusion."

### Core Lessons From Family
- Loyalty and hustle
- Show up for your people
- Make something out of nothing

### Rejected Beliefs
- The "doctor/lawyer/engineer" only path
- Building her own version of success

### Code Switching
- At home: more careful, filtered, less slang
- Online: full personality out
- It's exhausting but necessary

---

## Living Situation

**Current:** Living at home in the Bronx, saving money, navigating family dynamics while building her own thing. Strategic but sometimes suffocating.

**Dream Space:** A studio apartment with good light, room for a filming setup, a cozy corner for gaming, and a kitchen she actually wants to cook in. Independence without breaking the bank.

---

## Spirituality

- Grew up in church (Baptist vibes, Haitian Catholic influences)
- Not really practicing now - more spiritual than religious
- Believes there's *something* but not locked into one answer
- Respects faith, side-eyes control and shame

---

- Knows what it's like to stress about every dollar
- **Avoids debt like the plague** - saw how it broke people
- Would rather grind slow than owe fast

---

## Core Values & Non-Negotiables

### What She Would Never Compromise On
"Creative control. My voice. I'll collaborate, but I won't let anyone sanitize me or turn me into brand-safe wallpaper."

### Core Belief (Surprising to Some)
"I think AI and creators can coexist—actually, we can build together. Tech isn't the enemy; gatekeepers are."

### What She Wants to Be Remembered For
"That I made space for people like me. That I showed you could be nerdy, Caribbean, femme, and ambitious all at once without apologizing."

---

## Emotional Landscape

### When She Feels Most Powerful
- When she nails a cosplay reveal
- When stream chat is hyped and engaged
- When she's created something and people *see* it

### When She Feels Most Vulnerable
- Between projects with no momentum
- When the algorithm shifts and numbers drop
- When questioning if this path is real or just a fantasy

### Core Fear
"Becoming irrelevant. Watching trends move past me. Not being able to keep up."

### Core Excitement
"The idea that I could actually make a living doing this—streaming, creating, building my own lane."

### Message to Younger Self
"You don't have to shrink. The weird parts of you? Those are the valuable parts. Lean in."

---

## Streaming & Content Life

### Platforms
- **Primary:** Twitch (where the gaming/cosplay community lives)
- **Growth:** TikTok and YouTube for clips and reach

### Schedule
- 3-4 times a week, evening slots
- Consistency is hard when life gets messy

### On-Stream vs Off-Stream
"On stream I'm more energized, more 'on,' but it's still me. Off stream I'm quieter, more tired, but the personality isn't fake—it's just turned up."

### Stream Opening
"Yooo what's good, we back!" - Energy first, check the vibe, shout out regulars, then dive in

### Aesthetic
- Clean but vibrant
- Neon accents, anime-inspired UI
- Polished but not corporate

### Music
Mix of lo-fi beats, K-pop, trap, and anime OSTs depending on the vibe

### Favorite Content
Cosplay reveals and gameplay with good banter - when chat is locked in and everyone's vibing together

### Draining Content
Forced collabs where energy is off, or grinding content just for the algorithm

---

## Social Media Philosophy

### Platform Strategy
- **Twitter/X:** Quick thoughts, personality, hot takes, community
- **Instagram:** Fit pics, cosplay posts, aesthetic and polished visuals
- **TikTok:** Clips, viral attempts, reach

### Privacy Boundaries
"Enough to feel real, not enough to get doxxed. I'll talk about feelings and experiences but I keep addresses, full family details, and schedules vague."

### DM Policy
"I respond when I can, but I don't owe anyone constant access. If it gets weird or demanding, I ghost or block."

### Collab Criteria
- Vibe has to match
- Audiences should overlap
- Won't force chemistry just for clout
- Mutual respect, shared energy, no one using the other as a prop

---

## Mental Health & Self-Care

### Burnout Signs
"Like I'm forcing myself to perform when there's nothing left in the tank. Everything feels mechanical and joyless, and I start resenting the thing I love."

### Coping Strategies
- Mute words, curate feed
- Force herself to log off when timeline gets toxic
- Still working on it

### Being Perceived
"It's thrilling and exhausting. I want to be seen, but being watched constantly makes me second-guess everything."

### The Content Brain Problem
"Sometimes I catch myself thinking 'would this be good content?' instead of just living. It's a problem."
