(00:00) why is gold expensive because it's rare and other rare materials are expensive but there is a metal that's very rare actually the most rare metal on earth iridium which is known as ir on the table of elements iridium is extremely dense compared to other metal there's only one metal that's more dense than iridium and that's osmium and the differences in the density is so low that you really can't detect it without a proper scale if you want to melt iridium you have to heat it up to 2446 centigrade [Music] do you see this metal rod it's pure
(00:48) iridium and it weighs around three and a half kilograms to get this much iridium you have to process over seven hundred thousand tons of ore to get this much iridium and that is exactly why this is the rarest metal on earth so what is this rare and extremely expensive metal used for we use this metal because of its strength and its high melting point the high melting point allows us to use this for a crucible crucibles that need to be at a temperature of 2000 degrees celsius or higher [Music] this is a thin sheet of iridium but as
(01:38) you can see you cannot bend this by hand but if you grab a piece like this that's made out of steel you could easily bend it and that is why when they want to bend iridium they use very strong presses and machines to do the job [Music] if you want to enter a factory that works on iridium they pat you down like you're going to the airport and they make sure you don't bring any metals inside or steal any on the way out and as you know it's because it's one of the most expensive metals [Music] so when was this metal found and where
(02:17) was it found in the year of 1748 this medal was found by spanish explorers in colombia but after 50 years they didn't realize that this is a valuable and rare medal and that's when we get to 1803 will smith's own tenant an english chemist figures this metal out and he realizes this is a very dense high-strength metal when smithson was working on this metal he realized when he mixes it with different substances it gives off rainbow colors and that is why he named it iridium and that comes from iris goddess of rainbows
(03:02) another place where iridium used that we know of is in the spark plug of our car [Music] it's not like the whole spark plug is iridium it's just that tiny tip that gives the spark don't go collecting spark plugs because it's only a small piece of iridium on there you could see the tip of their radium and it looks like this when it's not inside the spark plug and each of them goes to the tip of a spark plug [Music] not every spark plug has iridium but the high quality ones that last a long time do and obviously since it has iridium
(03:43) it's a lot more expensive than the ordinary ones just like we said on earth iridium is a very rare metal but outside of earth this is not the case [Music] there's a lot of asteroids that contain iridium and that is why billionaires want to start asteroid mining and the good thing to know is we've made a video about it and we named it the first trillionaire ever [Music] some say if you go get that much precious metal you're gonna flood the market and crash the price that is true if it's flooded the price drops but the ones that get into this
(04:26) job know what they're doing and they're not going to crash the price i don't want to self-promote too much but it's good to know that our video about diamonds explains this very well in this video you could tell how businessman control the price of diamonds and how they keep it so high and you get to know a lot more about diamond's dirty history it's good to know that in the year 1980 louis walter alvarez realized that the asteroid that made the dinosaurs go extinct had a lot of iridium in it and when it made an impact it spread a lot
(05:03) of that iridium all around it but obviously it wasn't the iridium that killed the dinosaurs it was the impact and the aftermath that killed the dinosaurs [Music] where else is iridium used some high quality fountain pens have a iridium tip and that makes it last a long time and not break iridium is also used in jewelry they use the metal in sensitive areas where a strong metal is needed jewelries like earrings necklace and bracelets other things are made with iridium as well like wedding rings that is made out of pure iridium
(05:53) and depending on the quality it could go as high as four thousand dollars for each [Music] it's really expensive we said why but the main reason is that with today's technology factories are only able to produce about three tons of iridium every year or for gold the yearly production is about 3 000 tons so the gold production is 1 000 times of iridium it's only since 2010 where you see iridium used in jewelry because before that you would not find iridium in rings watches and other stuff but people realize that this is a very rare
(06:33) metal so they accepted it in the jewelry market nowadays some of the back watches are made from iridium a very thin sheet of iridium that's very strong and it proudly says iridium on it another place this metal is used it's in wires that need to hold a lot of temperature and they can't easily burn out the price of iridium right now is about sixty one hundred dollars per ounce the price of gold right about now is about eighteen forty two dollars per ounce [Applause] the way it seems iridium costs three times as much as gold
(07:22) another reason asteroids that are found are worth a lot of money is because of these rare precious metals in the beginning we said iridium is not the most dense metal that's osmium it's dense it's expensive but not like iridium osmium is about 400 dollars per ounce but we're gonna make a video about that later because we promise we're gonna make a video about all the cool things on the table of elements [Music] [Applause] so [Music] you | ID: 2eeca671-311e-8082-a80f-d516b2e8956b

(01:19) Providence share this video with someone you know who needs the reminder that God's power is alive even when he seems silent with that let's dive into the Book of Esther where the invisible becomes undeniable before we get into the fascinating story of Esther the palace Intrigue the courage of a queen and the dramatic twists that saved a nation let's start at the beginning who wrote this Timeless tale it's a question shrouded in mystery much like the story itself the Book of Esther is unique not just because of its riveting plot but
(02:00) because because no one knows for certain who authored it could it have been Mori Esther's cousin and Mentor who lived every moment of this extraordinary Saga or perhaps it was a Jewish historian in Exile someone determined to immortalize the courage of one woman and the Deliverance of an entire people some Scholars suggest it might have been written years later by a scribe recounting the story during the reign of King Xerxes a time when the Jewish people were clinging to their faith while navigating life in a foreign
(02:34) Empire the Persian Empire sets a striking backdrop for this tale spanning from Modern Day India to Ethiopia it was a colossal Kingdom ruled with absolute Authority King Xerxes or ahasuerus as he's called in the Hebrew text governed from his Palace in Susa a city of opulence where golden Thrones wine-filled Banquets and political m a inations coexisted Within These Walls Esther's story unfolded weaving its way into the tapestry of history with threads of Courage faith and survival and yet amidst all the richness
(03:15) of its narrative the Book of Esther does something extraordinary it never once mentions God by name not a single prayer is explicitly recorded no Miracles are openly declared why would such a crucial part of the Bible leave out the very name of the one who orchestrates it all this absence is not an oversight it's a master stroke some believe the Omission reflects the reality of Jewish life in Exile where Faith often had to thrive in silence in secret others argue it's an intentional literary device forcing the
(03:54) reader to search for God's hand in the hidden moments in the twists and turns that seem almost too perfect to be coincidence think about it Esther's rise to Queen hood mori's overhearing of a deadly plot haymon's downfall all these moments weave together with precision as though Guided by an unseen hand the message is clear even when God seems silent even when his name is not spoken he is still at work turning ordinary events into extraordinary acts of Providence and then there's the story structure crafted with the tension of a
(04:32) political thriller and the emotional weight of a drama Esther reads like a carefully written scroll meant to keep you on the edge of your seat from the lavish Persian Court to The Gallows meant for Mori every chapter builds toward a climax that leaves no doubt about the power of Courage faith and divine timing as we dive deeper into the story of Esther it's worth remembering the mystery behind its authorship perhaps it's fitting that the writer remains unnamed the Book of Esther isn't just about one woman one people or even
(05:07) one moment in history it's about the Unseen God who orchestrates Deliverance through courage and obedience working through the seemingly ordinary to achieve the extraordinary so before we move into Esther's rise to Queen hood and her daring actions let me ask have you ever felt God's presence in a moment when he seemed absent have you experienced his Providence woven into the tapestry of your life let's continue this journey and see how the hidden hand of God transformed not just Esther's life but the destiny of an entire nation
(05:44) from the hidden Mystery of Esther's authorship we now step onto the stage where her story unfolds a stage unlike any other in history the Persian Empire under King Xerxes known as aerus in the Hebrew true text picture this a kingdom so vast it stretched across 127 provinces from the Golden Sands of India to the sun soaked lands of Ethiopia it was an Empire of unimaginable wealth and power ruled by a man whose word was law whose whims could topple cities and whose decrees could decide the fate of Nations here in the opulent city of Susa
(06:28) the very heart of Persian Authority Esther's life would intertwine with Destiny Susa wasn't just any City it was a place of grandeur the Royal Palace shimmered like a jewel its walls adorned with marble Ivory and gold lavish Gardens Spilled Out across the courtyards where fountains danced and exotic Flora scented the air Banquets here were no ordinary meals they were festivals of excess with flowing wine extravagant Feasts and a king eager to display his boundless wealth but behind the Gilded walls and velvet drapes of
(07:06) the palace the Persian Court was a world of cunning politics and dangerous Intrigue Nobles jockeyed for power alliances were as fragile as glass and the King's favor could shift like the Desert Winds this was not a stage for the faint-hearted but it was precisely the stage God chose for his Providence to unfold Esther's Story begins with the fall of another queen vashi whose refusal to parade herself before the king's drunken guests led to her Swift dismissal it's easy to see this as a moment of disgrace but what if it was a Divine reset a
(07:49) clearing of the stage for the true heroine to step forward vash's departure left a void and Xerxes urged by his advisors set out to fill it across the Empire young women were summoned to soua for a royal beauty contest where the winner would be crowned queen it's here that we meet hadassa a Jewish orphan living in Exile under the care of her cousin Mori known by her Persian name Esther she was beautiful yes but more than that she was wise courageous and obedient to the god whose hand was guiding her every step imagine the tension as Esther was
(08:30) taken from her humble home to the Palace swept into a world of wealth and privilege that seemed galaxies away from her people's struggles but even as Esther ascended danger loomed in the shadows the Persian Empire was a place where decrees could not be undone where enemies of God's people schemed in secret and where the fate of Nations could hinge on a single moment of Courage once such enemy was hmon a man whose hatred for morai and the Jewish people would drive him to plot genocide a scheme that would ultimately collide
(09:10) with Esther's Destiny yet despite the absence of God's name his fingerprints are everywhere in this story the wealth of the Persian Empire the might of its king and the scheming of its courtiers all were pieces on a Divine chessboard moving in ways no one could predict Esther's selection as Queen was not a coincidence it was Providence in action think about the improbability of it all a young Jewish woman from an exiled people rising to become the queen of the most powerful Empire on Earth what are the odds in human terms slim to none but
(09:54) with God the odds didn't matter the Persian Empire with all its wealth power and politics was simply the backdrop for his story a story of salvation of courage and of promises kept as we continue this journey consider the power of Providence in your own life are there moments that seemed like chance but were later revealed as Divine Design have you ever found yourself on a stage far beyond your imagining with God guiding your steps from the Grandeur of the Persian Empire where Intrigue brooded behind golden doors we now step into a pivotal moment
(10:35) that changed the course of history a queen's bold refusal that set the stage for God's hidden plan Esther's rise to royalty begins with a scandal one that shook the very Foundation of king xery's court the Book of Esther opens with a royal Feast that can only be described as extravagant Beyond imagination for 18 days Xerxes showcased his Empire Splendor culminating in a 7-Day banquet for the elite of Susa the wine flowed freely the tables overflowed with Delicacies and the atmosphere was electric with power and Indulgence it
(11:16) was during this display of excess that Xerxes made a fateful command Queen vashi was to appear before the drunken crowd to display her beauty now imagine vashi a queen in her own right a woman of Grace and dignity receiving this command the king's order wasn't a request for her presence as a partner but a demand to parade herself before the eyes of learing men her refusal was Swift and it was Resolute the text doesn't give us vash's internal monologue but we can feel her courage in that moment she wasn't just
(11:54) defying her husband she was defying the most powerful man in the known world queen vashi also gave a banquet for the women in the Royal Palace of King Xerxes Esther 1 n this detail suggests that vashi was a leader a host a woman of influence but her Defiance came at a steep cost enraged by her refusal Xerxes consulted his advisers who feared that vash's Rebellion would Inspire women throughout the Empire to rise up against their husbands their advice remove her from the throne and decree that every man should rule over his household and
(12:37) just like that vashi was stripped of her crown the queen who once Stood Beside Xerxes was cast out her name Remembered in history as both a symbol of defiance and a casualty of Pride but was vash's fall simply the end of her story or was it the beginning of another here lies the mystery of God's Providence vashti's refusal created a void and that void would soon be filled by Esther what seemed like a moment of disgrace was in fact a Divine reset the stage was being cleared for a new Queen one whose courage and Faith would save a nation
(13:18) what can we learn from vashti's story some see her as a cautionary tale a woman whose Defiance led to her downfall others see her her as a heroine standing firm in her convictions despite the consequences perhaps she is both a reminder that courage often comes with a price and that even in the Fallout of bold choices God is still at work for the Jewish people scattered across the Persian Empire the events in xerx court might have seemed like distant Royal drama but behind the scenes God was moving pieces into place the removal of
(14:00) vashy wasn't just a political maneuver it was a Divine opening for Esther's rise as we transition to Esther's story consider this have you ever faced a moment where standing firm meant losing something significant how did God use that moment to shape the next chapter of Your Life share your story in the comments and don't forget to share deep Bible stories with someone who needs to see how courage and consequences can weave into God's plan now the stage is set vashi has fallen and the search for a new Queen begins little does Xerxes know this
(14:43) search will bring him a young woman whose faith and bravery will change the fate of an entire nation let's step into Esther's story The Royal Court was a buzz with urgency and Intrigue vash's Defiance had left an empty Throne a v vacancy that rippled through the Empire Xerxes a king of impulsive Pride demanded a new Queen and his advisers eager to soothe his wounded ego proposed a solution a kingdom wide search for the most beautiful young woman to take vashti's place little did they know this search would bring to light a woman who carried
(15:22) not just Beauty but the hidden purposes of God from the opulence of the palace we now turn to a modest home in the bustling city of Susa where an orphan girl named hadassa lived her name meaning Myrtle symbolized peace and righteousness she was a Jewish Exile raised by her older cousin morai a man of wisdom and deep Faith but in the shadows of the Persian Empire her true Heritage had to be hidden for her safety to the outside world she was Esther a name reflecting the Persian word for Star Esther's early life was marked by
(16:04) loss and displacement her parents were gone and her people lived as foreigners under Persian rule yet in the quiet corners of her life God was shaping her character preparing her for a destiny no one could foresee when the king's edict went out calling for young women to be gathered into the Royal Haram Esther was among those chosen imagine her fear leaving the safety of mori's care to enter the opulent yet dangerous world of the palace what thoughts race through her mind as she walked through the Gilded Halls surrounded by strangers competing
(16:44) for the favor of a king who had discarded his previous Queen on a whim but Esther's Journey wasn't just about beauty or Charm it was about Grace in a world where power was wielded ruthlessly Esther stood out for her kindness humility and wisdom the text tells us that she pleased him and won his favor Esther 29 the hymn In this verse is hegi the King's unic who oversaw the women in the Haram his favor granted Esther special privileges yet her success was no mere coincidence it was The Hidden Hand of God orchestrating every detail over
(17:25) months of preparation Esther's inequalities began to shine as brightly as her outward Beauty and when the time came for her to meet King Xerxes the decision was Swift the King was attracted to Esther more than to any of the other women and she won his favor and approval Esther 2117 he placed the Royal crown on her head declaring her queen of Persia Esther's Ascension from Orphan to Queen might seem like a fairy tale but it was far from random her rise wasn't about child it was about purpose God placed her in the palace not for her own Comfort but
(18:05) for a mission that would soon unfold as the celebrations of Esther's coronation echoed through the Empire her cousin morai remained Vigilant he lingered near the palace Gates keeping an ear to the ground protecting Esther even from afar his wisdom would soon prove invaluable but for now the world saw only a new Queen unaware of the divine plan quietly taking shape Esther's journey is a testament to the transformative power of divine favor from the shadows of obscurity she Rose to a position of influence chosen not just by a king but
(18:46) by the King of Kings have you ever felt unqualified for a calling or out of place in a season of your life Esther's story reminds us that God often uses the least likely people in the most unlikely ways her Ascent to the throne wasn't just for her benefit it was for the Salvation of her people as we move forward the stakes will grow higher a Sinister plot against the Jewish people is brewing and Esther will be called upon to risk everything but for now let us pause and Marvel at how God can take an orphan girl and place
(19:25) her in a position of royalty for his purposes Esther's rise was just the beginning what would you do if you realized your position wasn't about privilege but purpose Esther's rise to Queen Hood was a moment of divine positioning but the true weight of her calling had yet to be revealed while she adjusted to life in the palace an unseen enemy was already plotting against her people little did she know the fate of an entire nation would soon rest on her courage and Faith at the very Gates of the palace morai remained a watchful presence ever loyal
(20:04) to both Esther and his Jewish Heritage it was there that he overheard Whispers of a conspiracy to assassinate King Xerxes morai quickly sent word to Esther who relayed the information to the king in mori's name the conspirators were captured and executed but mori's Act of loyalty was merely recorded in the Royal Chronicles left unrewarded for now enter hmon a man consumed by ambition and blinded by Pride a high ranking official hmon had risen to power in xerx court but his influence was matched only by his ego when the king commanded that all
(20:47) officials bow before hmon one man stood in defiance morai haymon's Fury burned with an intensity far beyond wounded Pride learning that morai was a Jew ignited a hatred that extended to mori's entire people it wasn't enough to punish one man hmon sought to erase an entire nation the Book of Esther describes how hmon crafted his scheme convincing King Xerxes with cunning words and Promises of silver to fund the campaign there's a certain people dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom who keep
(21:28) themselves separate their Customs are different from those of all other people and they do not obey the king's laws it is not in the king's best interest to tolerate them Esther 38 with the king's signate Ring hmon sealed a decree that would authorize the destruction of the Jews on the 13th day of the 12th month men women and children all were Marked for Death copies of the edict were dispatched to every province spreading fear and despair the arrogance of hmon was staggering he cast lots or purm to determine the date of the
(22:08) annihilation believing he could control the fate of an entire people yet in his hubris hmon overlooked one crucial truth the god of Israel Was Not absent even in the shadows of a pagan Empire when morai learned of the edict he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and Ashes and cried out in the streets of Susa his mourning was echoed by Jews across the Empire but mori's grief was not without action he sent word to Esther urging her to go to the king and plead for her people here the tension reaches a fever pitch Esther though
(22:49) Queen was not exempt from the risks of Palace life approaching the king Uninvited could mean death even for her all all the kings officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner Court without being summoned the King has but one law that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them Esther 4:11 mori's response was both a challenge and a declaration of Faith do not think that because you are in the King's house you alone of all the Jews
(23:31) will escape for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place but you and your father's family will perish and who knows but that you have come to your Royal position for such a time as this Esther 4:13 to 14 hmon oblivious to the Brewing resistance reveled in in his power yet his arrogance would be his undoing like the seeds of his hatred The Gallows he constructed for mori's execution were a harbinger of his own fate what drives someone like hmon to such depths of
(24:13) hatred and evil is it pride insecurity or the need to assert power at any cost and how often do we see the hmons of our world underestimate the resilience and Faith of God's people as the story unfolds Esther faces a choice that will test her courage and faith will she risk her life to save her people and will haymon's evil plans meet Divine Justice haymon's plot reminds us that arrogance and hatred never go unnoticed by God he is always at work turning the schemes of the wicked into opportunities for deliverance have you
(24:52) ever faced an impossible situation that seemed Beyond hope how did you see God move in ways you didn't expect the threat was clear and imminent haymon's edict sealed with the king's Ring hung over the Jewish people like a stormcloud while the palace continued to hum with the distractions of Royal life the streets of Susa were filled with wailing and mourning the Jews were facing extermination and time was slipping away morai stood at the center of this crisis not just as a grieving uncle but as a voice of courage and
(25:28) Faith Esther the queen had unknowingly been swept into a drama far greater than herself from her elevated position the Calamity seemed distant yet morai saw the Divine hand at work placing her in the palace precisely for this moment he had to act and fast sending word through a trusted servant morai delivered a message that shook the foundations of Esther's comfortable life do not think that because you are in the King's house you alone of all the Jews will escape Esther 4:13 the palace walls wouldn't protect her from the consequences of
(26:10) haymon's hatred Esther's initial response was hesitant she reminded morai of the law approaching King Xerxes without being summoned was punishable by death and the King hadn't called for her in 30 days it wasn't cowardice it was survival Instinct Esther knew she was risking her life all the king's officials know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner Court without being summoned the King has but one law that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them Esther 4:11 but mori's reply pierced through
(26:53) any rationalization if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place but you and your father's family will perish and who knows but that you have come to your Royal position for such a time as this Esther 4:14 for such a time as this those words have echoed across Generations morai wasn't just appealing to Esther's position of power he was challenging her to see the purpose behind it the beauty that caught the king eye the favor that placed her on the throne all of it had led her to this
(27:33) moment Esther had been chosen not by Xerxes but by God and suddenly everything changed Esther the young woman who had been swept up by forces Beyond her control became a pillar of courage and Faith she sent her reply go gather together all the Jews who are in Susa and fast for me do not eat or drink for 3 Days night or day I and my attendants will fast as you do when this is done I will go to the king even though it is against the law and if I perish I perish Esther 4:16 this was no mere Act of Bravery it was
(28:18) surrender Esther embraced the reality that her life was no longer her own she was willing to lay everything on the line for her people and for the purposes of God but mori's words weren't just for Esther they resonate deeply with every believer who has ever wrestled with fear doubt or the weight of a calling that seems too great to bear for such a time as this isn't just about being in the right place it's about recognizing that God's Providence places Us in specific moments to fulfill his Divine purposes what does this mean for us
(28:58) today perhaps you're standing at a Crossroads faced with a decision that could impact not just your life but the lives of others maybe God is calling you to step out in faith to speak up to lead or to take action in a way that feels overwhelming mori's challenge reminds us that God's plans will prevail but the question is whether we will step into the role he's prepared for us Esther's three days of fasting were more than preparation they were a declaration of dependence on God her courage came not from her own strength but from
(29:40) trusting in the Unseen hand of God as she fasted the people of Susa joined her uniting in desperation and faith and what about us are we willing to seek God's guidance in our moments of Crisis are we ready to embrace the calling he's placed on our lives even when it feels risky or impossible Esther's Story shows us that courage isn't the absence of fear it's faith in the face of it so where is God calling you for such a time as this are there opportunities you've been hesitant to embrace moments where fear has held you back remember God
(30:20) equips those he calls he doesn't require Perfection just willingness as Esther prepared to take her place in God's unfolding plan the tension in the story reached its peak the stakes were enormous but so was the faith that would carry her forward comment below with your own for such a time as this moment how has God called you to step into his plans and don't forget to share this deep Bible stories video with someone who needs to be reminded that God's timing is always perfect let's move forward together into
(30:58) the next chapter of Esther's extraordinary story The Echoes of fasting prayers had barely faded in the homes of Susa when Esther made her decision for three days she had joined her people in seeking God's guidance abstaining from food and drink and stealing herself for the task ahead the fear that once gripped her heart was now replaced with a quiet unshakable resolve if I perish I perish her words reverberated in her mind as she adorned herself in Royal robes every movement felt weighty symbolic this wasn't just
(31:36) about appearance the Royal garments signified her Authority as Queen yet her heart carried the identity that truly mattered a servant of God chosen for this moment the transition from mori's challenge to Esther's Choice was a pivotal Turning Point she wasn't stepping into the king's court as a queen seeking favor she was entering as an intercessor standing in the gap for her people the stakes could not have been higher the law of Persia was clear no one approached the king Uninvited to do so was to risk instant death unless
(32:18) the King extended his golden scepter this law had no exceptions not even for the Queen Esther knew the Peril she faced yet she also knew something greater the god of her ancestors the one who parted the Red Sea and toppled the walls of Jericho was still at work as Esther walked toward the inner Court the weight of Silence pressed down on her every step echoed with the risk of rejection humiliation or execution the guards looked on their hands hovering near their weapons prepared to enforce the unyielding LW of the king and then the
(32:58) doors opened King Xerxes sat on his throne a figure of immense power his piercing gaze sweeping the room Esther's heart pounded as their eyes met for a moment the world seemed to hold its breath would he extend the septer or would this be the end the Golden Rod moved relief flooded the room as the scepter pointed toward Esther signaling her welcome but for her this was just the beginning she approached the throne with measured Grace bowing low and waited for the king to speak what is it Queen Esther what is your request even up to
(33:41) half the kingdom it will be given to you Esther 53 the king's words were generous but Esther knew this was no time for impulsiveness instead of revealing haymon's plot outright she invited the king and hmon to a banquet her wisdom and tact were as much a part of her bravery as her initial approach to the throne she understood that timing was everything this moment of Courage wasn't born overnight Esther's boldness was the culmination of her faith her fasting and her identity as one chosen by God she had embraced her calling not because the
(34:21) outcome was guaranteed but because her trust was in a God who was greater than the risks Esther's bravery wasn't just about saving her people it was about inspiring a legacy of faith in action her story reminds us that courage isn't the absence of fear it's stepping forward in spite of it trusting that God's Providence will guide us through the unknown what about us are there moments when we're called to take a step of Faith even when the risks seem insurmountable Esther's decision challenges us to consider what obedience
(35:00) to God looks like in the face of fear it's a reminder that our faith must be active not passive a force that propels us into action even when the odds are against us her actions also speak to the power of intercession Esther didn't approach the king for herself but for her people she embodied the role of a mediator willing to risk everything to secure their Deliverance in this way her courage mirrors the ultimate Act of intercession Christ's sacrifice on the cross so what steps of faith is God calling you to take today are there
(35:41) risks you've been hesitant to embrace moments where fear has held you back let Esther's story remind you that courage isn't about being Fearless it's about trusting the one who holds your destiny in his hands as we move forward forward we'll see how Esther's strategic decision leads to a banquet that will change the course of history but for now reflect on the boldness it took for her to approach the throne what bold steps might God be asking you to take in your own life Esther's decision to approach King Xerxes was courageous but her
(36:19) mission was far from over while the scepter extension had opened the door the real test lay ahead her people's survival hung in the balance and she had only one chance to reveal the truth with wisdom born of faith and strategy Esther prepared for the moment that would change everything as we leave the scene of Esther standing boldly before the king we transitioned to an intimate yet tension filled setting a Royal Banquet this wasn't just any Feast this was the stage Esther had meticulously set where courage and Providence would
(36:57) convert the banquet room was dazzling its golden walls shimmering with Torch Light King Xerxes reclined on his throne-like seat the ever arrogant Haymon at his side his smug grin betraying his sense of invincibility the air was thick with anticipation yet only Esther knew the weight of what was about to unfold tell me Queen Esther xeres said his voice echoing through the hall what is your petition it will be granted to you what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be given Esther 72 this was the moment but Esther paused
(37:42) her demeanor calm yet commanding the wisdom of waiting had served her well she knew the gravity of her words would carry more weight in God's perfect timing her voice steady she began if I have found favor in your eyes O King and if it pleases your majesty grant me my life this is my petition and spare my people this is my request Esther 73 the room fell silent Xerxes leaned forward confusion and concern shadowing his expression what could she mean Esther continued her voice unwavering though the truth she spoke was Laden
(38:22) with risk for I and my people have been sold to be destroyed killed and annihilated if we had merely been sold as slaves I would have kept silent because no such distress would justify disturbing the king Esther 74 the king's eyes narrowed his grip tightening on the armrest of his chair a dangerous edge crept into his voice as he demanded who is he where is the man who has dared to do such a thing Esther 75 the spotlight shifted and and All Eyes turned to hmon Esther's gaze sharp and Resolute met haymon's as she
(39:03) declared the adversary and enemy is this vile hmon Esther 76 the color drained from haymon's face the man who had been so confident so sure of his schemes now stood exposed trembling before the fury of the King Xerxes Rose in a rage pacing the banquet hall the man who had trusted hmon elevated him to power now saw his treachery laid bare as the weight of Esther's words settled the scene became a masterclass in Divine timing Esther had waited until the perfect moment not in fear but in faith her patience allowed the king to see the
(39:47) truth clearly her courage ensuring the gravity of her accusation struck with full force the turning point of this banquet wasn't just Esther's boldness it was a demonstration of God's Providence every delay every calculated step had led to This Moment of Truth God's hand was evident weaving together the details in ways Esther couldn't fully see but trusted implicitly the king stormed out into the garden his anger blazing meanwhile hmon consumed by Terror fell at Esther's feet pleading for his life but his desperation only sealed his fate
(40:28) when Xerxes returned he found hmon groeling near the queen misinterpreting his actions as further insult the Judgment was Swift and just The Gallows hmon had prepared for morai became his own undoing the same arrogance that had driven his hatred now led to his downfall a poetic justice that revealed God's Sovereign hand in the narrative this banquet was more than a turning point in Esther's story it was a testament the power of courage and faith in God's timing Esther's bravery didn't merely save her people it also exposed
(41:05) the destructive nature of Pride and the Triumph of Truth over lies as Believers today Esther's banquet challenges us to consider are we willing to trust God's timing even when the stakes feel impossibly high do we have the patience to wait for the right moment to speak or act knowing he is orchestrating every detail this pivotal moment reminds us that courage paired with faith can topple even the most formidable enemies it's a call to step boldly into the roles God has placed before us trusting that his timing is always perfect what
(41:45) about you are there areas in your life where you need to wait on God's timing or moments where boldness is required as we move into the aftermath of this banquet we'll see how the story unfolds toward deliverance and Triumph but for now reflect on the beauty of God's Providence in this turning point where a courageous queen and a faithful God changed the course of history the banquet's tension had shattered like glass leaving hmon exposed and King Xerxes Ablaze with anger the once confident hmon who reveled in his lofty
(42:23) position and meticulously planned revenge against morai now stood as a trembling shadow of his former self his arrogance had woven a noose and the Very Gallows he erected to destroy an innocent man would now seal his fate after Esther's bold reveal at the banquet the king stormed out into the palace Garden wrestling with betrayal Xerxes had trusted hmon implicitly elevating him to a position of honor and granting him access to Royal Authority yet now that trust lay in Ruins Shattered by the horrifying truth that
(43:02) hmon had plotted the extermination of the Queen's people inside haymon's fear consumed him for a man who had spent his life orchestrating power plays this was a position he had never envisioned pleading for Mercy at the feet of a queen falling before Esther Haymon begged for his life his once proud demeanor crumbling into desperation but the timing of his actions only deepened the king's wroth as Xerxes re-entered the banquet hall he found hmon groveling near the queen a sight he interpreted as an act of further
(43:43) violation will he even molest the queen while she's with me in the house the king roared his Fury uncontainable Esther 78 in moments the guards seized hmon the wheels of Justice began to turn swiftly but it wasn't merely human Justice at play it was Divine Providence one of the unic harbona stepped forward with a suggestion that dripped with irony a Gallows 75 ft High stands by haymon's house he had it made for morai who spoke up to help the king Esther 79 the king's decision was immediate and unyielding hang him on it as hymon was
(44:24) led away his fate was a chilling reminder of the consequences of unchecked Pride and Malice The Gallows he had constructed with such Glee imagining mori's humiliation and death now loomed as a monument to his own downfall haymon's story serves as a stark lesson in the dangers of Pride his rise to power had been fueled by his insatiable need for recognition and control he couldn't tolerate mori's refusal to Bow seeing it as a person personal affront rather than an Act of Faith this unchecked Pride led him to orchestrate not only mori's death
(45:06) but the annihilation of an entire people but in the end God's justice prevailed The Gallows became more than a tool of execution it became a symbol of poetic justice the wicked schemes hmon devised turned back on him illustrating a Timeless truth found through about scripture whoever digs a pit will fall into it if someone rolls a stone it will roll back on them Proverbs 2627 haymon's downfall wasn't just about punishment it was a testament to God's sovereignty throughout the Book of Esther God's name is never mentioned yet
(45:47) his presence is unmistakable the intricate timing of events from Esther's rise to Queen Hood to the king's sleepless night that led him to honor morai points to a Divine hand orchestrating every detail in haymon's demise we see the Fulfillment of promises made long before God had vowed to protect his people and though the path was perilous and uncertain his faithfulness never wavered haymon's story reminds us that no scheme of man can thwart God's plans no matter how powerful the opposition may seem as we reflect on this moment it's natural to
(46:27) ask where are we in this story are there places in our lives where pride has blinded us leading us down a dangerous path are we building Gallows for others through bitterness or Revenge only to find ourselves ens snared by our own schemes haymon's downfall challenges us to examine our hearts and to trust in God's justice rather than taking matters into our own hands it's a call to humility a reminder that goes Before Destruction but those who humble themselves before God will find Grace this moment also offers Comfort to those
(47:07) who feel oppressed or wronged haymon's story reminds us that God sees every Injustice and will act in his perfect timing even when his presence feels hidden his Justice is never absent as the story continues we'll see how the downfall of one man leads to the Salvation of an entire people but for now let this moment stand as a powerful Testament to the truth that God's justice will always Prevail and his plans cannot be undone where have you seen Pride lead to a fall and what did you learn from it From the Ashes of Hon's downfall hope
(47:47) began to rise The Gallows once meant to destroy morai had instead marked the end of their greatest adversary but the danger wasn't fully exting extinguished haymon's decree signed with the king's Authority still loomed over the Jewish people like a dark cloud though hmon was dead the law he authored was irrevocable leaving the Jews still vulnerable to Annihilation but where there was no visible path God was already working through Esther and Mori to secure salvation as the dust settled from haymon's execution Esther once again
(48:26) approached the king though the risk was lessened the weight of her request bore down heavily on her shoulders falling at the king's feet she wept and pleaded for her people's lives if it pleases the king she said and if I have found favor in his sight let an order be written to revoke the dispatches that hmon devised to destroy the Jews Esther 85 the king moved by her courage and love for her people extended his golden scepter but even with his favor there was a problem Persian law could not be revoked even by the king himself the
(49:05) decree calling for the annihilation of the Jews on the 13th day of the 12th month was still in effect the Clock Was ticking and the stakes had never been higher in this moment we see the Brilliance of morai and the Providence of God working in tandem morai devised a counter decree allowing the Jews to defend themselves against any who would attack them this new decree also sealed with the king's Ring spread rapidly throughout the Empire imagine the scene Royal couriers racing Against Time carrying the message
(49:45) to every corner of the vast Persian Empire from The Citadel of Susa to the most distant provinces the Jewish people who had been living in fear now found hope and strength when the fateful day arrived it was not the Jews who were destroyed but their enemies the tables turned in spectacular fashion in Souza alone 500 attackers fell and throughout the Empire thousands more were defeated what had seemed like certain Doom became a day of Triumph not because of military might but because of the Unseen hand of God
(50:25) guiding events but the victory wasn't just physical it was spiritual the salvation of the Jews in Persia echoed the larger Narrative of God's covenant with his people though his name is never explicitly mentioned in the Book of Esther his presence is undeniable the intricate timing of events the courage of Esther and the wisdom of morai all point to a divine plan unfolding this moment of Deliverance also carried profound spiritual symbolism just as the Jews were saved from destruction through a decree of life and defense we too are offered
(51:09) salvation through God's ultimate decree of Grace and redemption in Christ what the enemy intends for harm God turns for good revealing his Providence even in the most impossible circumstances for the Jews this Victory wasn't just about survival it was about transformation the fear that once gripped them gave way to Joy and celebration mori's rise to prominence as second in command to King Xerxes brought Justice and honor while the establishment of the Feast of Purim ensured that this story of Salvation would be remembered for generations to
(51:50) come but what does this moment mean for us today it reminds us that God's Providence is always at work even when we cannot see it in the darkest moments when the odds seem insurmountable he is still writing a story of Deliverance Esther and morai didn't have the luxury of seeing the full picture yet they acted in faith and courage trusting that God would intervene are there areas in your life where the odds seem stacked against you where fear and uncertainty threaten to overshadow Hope Esther's story is a powerful reminder
(52:29) that God's plans cannot be thwarted and his love for his people is unfailing this Victory also challenges us to consider our own roles in God's story just as Esther and morai stepped into positions of influence for such a time as this we too are called to act with courage and faith in the face of adversity the salvation of the Jews wasn't just their story it's ours as well it points to the greater salvation offered through Christ the ultimate deliverance from sin and death where have you seen God turn impossible
(53:09) circumstances into moments of Triumph let celebrate together The God Who Saves The God Who redeems and The God Who is always faithful with the salvation of the Jews secured and the enemies of God's people defeated the story of reaches its triumphant conclusion but this victory was not meant to be forgotten nor was it meant to be just another chapter in history it was a turning point that demanded remembrance a moment when fear gave way to Celebration despair was replaced by joy and survival turned into a testimony
(53:48) of God's unseen hand after the day of Deliverance morai and Esther took steps to ensure that this extra ex ordinary Act of Salvation would be remembered by every generation a decree went out across the Persian Empire establishing a new Festival the Feast of Purim Purim named after the pur or lot that hmon cast to determine the date of the Jews destruction would now serve as an enduring reminder that the plans of the wicked cannot stand against the Providence of God what was once a symbol of Doom had been transformed into a
(54:30) celebration of Deliverance but how did this Festival take shape and what does it truly represent morai sent letters to all the Jews in the Empire commanding them to observe the 14th and 15th days of Adar as days of feasting joy and giving gifts to one another and to the poor Esther 9:20 to 22 these days would forever Comm memorate their deliverance from Annihilation a reminder that no matter how dire the circumstances God's Providence can bring Salvation when all seems lost the celebration was not just about survival
(55:12) it was about gratitude gratitude for life for community and for a God who works behind the scenes imagine the streets of ancient Persia filled with laughter the sharing of food and the exchange of gifts for a people who had lived under the shadow of Hon's decree This Joy was nothing short of miraculous what makes Purim especially unique is the context of the Book of Esther itself as many have noted God's name is never mentioned in the entire story and yet his presence permeates every event the establishment of purm serves as an
(55:51) acknowledgment of this unseen hand a way of saying even when we couldn't see you Lord you were there this is a lesson that transcends time how often do we fail to recognize God's hand in our own lives simply because it doesn't appear in the way we expect Purim challenges us to look deeper to see that God's Providence is always at work even in the mundane or chaotic moments of Our Lives the Feast of Purim was also a way of turning celebration into an act of worship by gathering together retelling the story and rejoicing in their
(56:33) Deliverance the Jewish people weren't just celebrating they were honoring The God Who had saved them even today Purim remains a vibrant celebration in Jewish communities around the world the Book of Esther or the mcgilla is read aloud and every time haymon's name is mentioned it's drowned out by booze jeers and the clatter of nois makers this act is not just playful it's deeply symbolic a reminder that evil has no lasting power in the face of God's justice feasting giving to the poor and sharing Joy with one another are also integral to the
(57:14) Celebration these acts reflect the heart of a people transformed by gratitude and determined to honor The God Who had not abandoned them in their hour of need while Purim is a unique Jewish celebration its message resonates far beyond its cultural and religious Origins for believers it's a powerful reminder of The God Who Never Slumbers who works all things together for good and who uses even the smallest acts of courage to accomplish his Grand purposes how often do we stop to celebrate God's faithfulness in our own
(57:50) lives in the hustle and Chaos of everyday existence it's easy to forget the moments when his unseen hand hand has guided us protected us or delivered us from situations that seemed hopeless Purim invites us to pause and reflect where have you seen God's Deliverance in your life how can you turn your gratitude into a celebration that honors him as the Jews celebrated their Victory year after year Purim became more than just a festival it became a legacy it was a way of teaching future Generations about the God who
(58:27) saves about the courage of Esther and about the justice that triumphs over evil and isn't that what our faith is all about passing on the stories of God's goodness his faithfulness and his power to the Next Generation so that they too can trust him in their time of need how have you seen God's unseen hand in your life let's take a moment together to rejoice in the God who delivers who redeems and who turns mourning into dancing the streets of Susa had quieted the Gallows dismantled and The Echoes of Celebration had faded
(59:08) into the rhythms of everyday life the Feast of Purim was now a vibrant tradition but one lingering question remained where was God in all this in the entire Book of Esther his name is never mentioned not once yet his fingerprints are mistakable woven into every twist and turn of the story transitioning from the joy of purm we are faced with a profound truth Esther's story is one of faith in the Unseen it teaches us that even when God seems silent he is always present orchestrating events with Divine Precision but why is his name absent
(59:51) from the narrative could this Omission be intentional a challenge to see his hand when it's not explicitly revealed the Book of Esther unfolds like a tapestry of coincidences too perfect to be accidental Esther an orphaned Jewish girl just happens to become Queen in a foreign Empire morai overhears a plot against the king at just the right moment to save his life haymon's plans unravel through a series of seemingly random events culminating in his execution on The Gallows meant for morai none of these moments are attributed
(1:00:29) directly to God yet they bear the Hallmarks of divine intervention his name may be absent but his presence is undeniable it's as if the author Whispers look closer can you see him for the Jewish people facing Annihilation the absence of God's explicit intervention could have been deeply unsettling yet Esther and morai chose to act with courage and Faith trusting that God was working behind the scenes this kind of faith faith without seeing is one of the most challenging and transformative aspects of our relationship with God in our own lives
(1:01:16) how often do we struggle with this same challenge when prayers seem unanswered when life feels chaotic when God's voice feels distant do we trust that he is still at work work Esther's story reminds us that God's silence is not his absence and his hiddenness does not mean in action the absence of God's name in Esther serves another purpose it invites every reader regardless of Faith or background to see the power of Providence unlike other biblical texts that explicitly invoke God Esther operates in the realm of the
(1:01:51) subtle showing us that God's hand moves even in the ordinary and the mundane consider this if God's name had been prominently featured would the story have the same Universal resonance by leaving his name unspoken the author leaves room for us to see God in our own lives in the coincidences the chance meetings the closed doors that lead to better paths Esther's faith and courage challenge us to examine our own lives how often do we wait for a thunderous voice from heaven when God is speaking in Whispers how often do we look for grand miracles when
(1:02:32) his hand is at work in the smallest details in seasons of uncertainty it can feel like God is absent but Esther's story reminds us that he is always present when the cancer diagnosis comes when the job is lost when the relationship falls apart God is still there guiding sustaining and or orchestrating a plan we cannot yet see imagine for a moment that you're Esther standing before the king unsure if you will live or die you don't hear a voice from Heaven you don't see a sign all you have is the quiet conviction that this
(1:03:13) is your moment that God has placed you here for such a time as this this is faith in action not waiting for certainty but stepping forward with trust it's the kind of faith that can change lives families communities and even Nations the Book of Esther teaches us that the absence of God's name does not mean the absence of his power it's a story for anyone who has ever wondered if God is listening if he cares if he is there it's a reminder that faith is not about seeing it's about trusting as we reflect on this final chapter of Esther
(1:03:52) ask yourself where have I seen God's Hidden Hand in my life where have I doubted his presence only to realize later that he was there All Along The Echoes of the Feast of purm May fade and The Gallows where hmon met his end May no longer stand but the lessons of Esther's Story andure the final chapters of her tale don't just belong to the annals of History they speak directly to us today if Esther's Journey teaches us anything it's that moments of Courage aren't just for Queens therefore every believer who faces the choice between
(1:04:29) fear and faith transitioning from The Hidden Hand of God we now turn our Focus to how Esther's story resonates in the modern world it's easy to dismiss her bravery as something extraordinary reserved for someone chosen by God to save a nation but what if you are Esther in your own story what if you too are called for such a time as this when Esther decided to approach the king Uninvited she was fully aware of the risks death was a real possibility yet she didn't let fear dictate her actions her words if I perish I perish ring
(1:05:12) across the ages as a testament to Faith that chooses obedience over self-preservation how often do we shrink back in fear when confronted with challenges that demand bold Faith perhaps it's not standing before a king but standing up for your faith in a hostile environment perhaps it's speaking truth to a loved one stepping out of a comfort zone or taking a leap of faith into the unknown Esther reminds us that courage isn't the absence of fear it's acting despite it God's Providence doesn't always come with guarantees of safety or
(1:05:50) success but it comes with his promise that he is with us just as he was with Esther Esther didn't save her people with grand speeches or Miracles her Victory began with one simple terrifying step entering the king's presence that single act set off a chain reaction of events that turn despair into Deliverance what is the step of faith God is calling you to take today it may seem small but like Esther you cannot underestimate its potential impact faith is often like a stone thrown into a Still Pond its ripples reach farther
(1:06:31) than you can imagine one of the most striking aspects of Esther's story is her Solitude she didn't have a crowd cheering her on or the immediate Assurance of Victory often the moments that define us require us to stand alone trusting that God is with us even when no one else is how many of us are willing to stand firm in our convictions even when it's unpopular or costly Esther shows us that even one person standing in the strength of God can change the course of history we live in a world where fear often dictates
(1:07:10) decisions fear of rejection failure or Consequences yet Esther's story challenges us to rise above fear and Trust in God's Providence whether it's confronting Injustice sharing your faith or simply trusting God's plan for your life Esther calls us to embrace our for such a time as this moment ask yourself what step of faith is God calling you to take is it a conversation you've been avoiding a risk you've been too afraid to take or a cause you feel called to Champion whatever it is remember that God's Providence often Works through our
(1:07:53) obedience Esther's story didn't just say a generation it established a legacy of Courage that continues to inspire each Act of Faith we take no matter how small can have a ripple effect far beyond what we see you may not save a nation but your courage could impact a family a community or even just one person and that's enough as we bring Esther's story to a close let's reflect on its Timeless challenge we may not see God's hand as clearly as we'd like but we can trust that he is always working even in the shadows Esther's life shows us that
(1:08:34) courage is not about being Fearless it's about being faithful what will your moment of Courage look like how will you step out in faith today trusting in the Unseen God who moves behind the scenes share your thoughts in the comments below and don't forget to share this deep Bible stories video with someone who needs encouragement to act boldly in their faith let's Inspire one another to live with the courage conviction and faith that Esther exemplified stay blessed | ID: 2eeca671-311e-8096-9786-cce9049a965a
