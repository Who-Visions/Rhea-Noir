Transcript:
(00:00) Hello everyone. Hello everyone. Our 1:30 presentation from Dr. Filippo Beyond and Armando May will be starting in just a moment. If people will take their seats. Thank you. I want to remind folks while people are getting settled that [clears throat] short of putting your phone on a tripod on the stage and recording the entire presentation, feel please feel free to share any of this stuff, but please tag it CosmicSummit, you know, so people can see other people's stuff when they go hit your tags. But you're welcome to
(00:44) film any of this that you like. Hopefully not end to end, but you know, but please, you know, tweet, post, and share this stuff. It's important. You're a part of getting this information out, too. And it's going to be mind-blowing. But I'll leave the introduction to our researchers to um my friend Jay Anderson of Project Unity. Thank you, Jay.
(01:15) Let me firstly uh thank you to all of you for being here for [clears throat] such an important moment for alternative history. It's my great honor to introduce two individuals whose work is at the forefront of rewriting what we thought we knew about ancient Egypt and the mysteries of the Giza Plateau. A few months ago, the world was shocked when a groundbreaking scientific team publicly announced the results of a radar survey beneath the Cafrey pyramid.
(01:43) Utilizing advanced synthetic aperture radar and Doppler imaging technologies, they revealed data suggesting the presence of previously unknown and extremely large subterranean chambers and architectural anomalies buried beneath one of the most iconic structures on Earth, the Carfrey Pyramid.
(02:05) Since then, they have discovered even more in relation to the Giza Plateau and what lies beneath its sands. And now two members of the Cafrey Pyramid Project are with us today. They've traveled all the way over from Italy to be here to show you what they've discovered. Professor Filippo Beyond, a physicist. Thank you. Yep. [applause and cheering] [cheering] Beyond is a physicist and remote sensing expert with decades of experience in aerospace technologies and radar based imaging systems.
(02:42) He uh his meticulous methodology and innovative signal processing techniques have allowed us to see literally into the bedrock of ancient history. And standing alongside him is Armando May. Can we get a round of applause please for Armando May. [cheering and applause] Armando. [applause] Armando is a journalist, a researcher, a historian whose tireless investigations into ancient civilizations have challenged mainstream timelines and brought the light brought to light suppressed or overlooked evidence. His deep dives into historical
(03:19) texts, esoteric records, and planetary alignments have helped form uh these radar findings, helped frame them, sorry, helped frame these radar findings with a much larger historical and also spiritual context. It's been a real pleasure to spend time with these gentlemen over the last few months. I've gotten to know Filippo and Armando, and I know that what they have to say and what they have to show you today could change everything.
(03:47) It really could change everything about the human story and the fact that it's really starting to look like a story with significant chapters missing. What you're seeing today is an attempt to find some of those missing chapters of our story. So, please join me in welcoming Filipo Beyond and Armando May. [cheering and applause] [applause] >> Thank you.
(04:16) Well, uh before to start my presentation, I would like to share with you a message from the team leader of the cafer research project, Professor Karado Malanga. Uh we are really honored to uh attend the cosmic summit and above all to share with uh experts from all around the world our the results of our research at uh on the Giz Plato.
(04:48) It's a great pleasure, a great honor for us uh your interest in our research and above all your support. Thank you so much. I apologize for my English of course. Uh uh my work in u in the cafrey research project uh is based on a prec precise uh uh target. uh to understand through rigorous scientific analytic models the pivotal events that may have shaped our remote past and and above all the evolution of our species.
(05:43) uh of course by integrating different methodological approaches including historical analysis, archaeological excavation and scientific modeling. And the my aim is to find the key to better understand previously unrecognized narratives that could redefine our understanding of human origins and the early civilization.
(06:14) To understand the origin of ancient myth and the evolution of human civilization, I focuses the uh intersection of symbolic narratives, material culture and historical processes utilizing three key methods. The study of the myth, the analysis of the archetypes as universal symbols across cultures and a detailed multi-disciplinary examination of Giza through mathematical, geological, astronomical models that might really reveal aspects of ancient knowledge totally unknown.
(06:58) Let's analyze the first step of my investigation. In my opinion, myths often contain encoded memories of real historical events, especially when combined with scientific data and placed in chronological order. According to this introduction, I found three basic epoch in the last 100,000 years characterized the evolution of the lost cultures.
(07:29) 75 70,000 years ago, the Toba super volcano eruption. This Indonesian eruption caused a global volcanic winter and according to anthropologist a genetic bottleneck human population. The 36400 before Christ is the zeppi according to the Egyptian mythology and the zepapi represent the rise of a new order a new world dominated by the demigods until the first dynasty of the pharaohs and then 10 fi 10,500 before Christ the great flood this epoch marks the end of the civilization of the gods and the start of a new era. Survivors of the
(08:23) cataclysm form the basis for f future civilizations like the Sumerian and the Egyptians. To understand ancient myth, I believe uh we have to look to the paleomagnetism and the place to shine a climate dynamics. Pomagnetism research reveals the Earth's geographical axis as naturally oscillated. Miss speaking of words overturned or lost directions could encode ancestral memories of sophysical transformations reflecting cosmic disorder or re reversed seasons.
(09:07) In this case, the Egyptian papiri like the hermitage or ew wound papiri may manifest these ancient records. And the final ptoan epox so intense glaciation and abrupt climatic fluctuations. Many myths of destructions, floods and rebirths resonate with this period. Now let's expand on paleomagnetism role in understanding earth's history.
(09:41) These fields reconstructs earth's geological past providing objective data on its magnetic field and geohysical axis stability. Crucially, current evidence show Earth's axis has remained stable within its natural oillation range for millions of years even after the topas super volcano eruption.
(10:07) This contradicts hypothesis of dramatic geog geographical ax axial shifts like those suggested for the north pole in North America which lack scientific support. Recognizing this distinction is vital. It allows us to separate scientifically validate geophysical events from speculative reconstructions grounding our interpretation of ancient myths and empirical evidence.
(10:36) When tracing ancient memories through myth, we encounter theories like Charles Hapgood's uh earth crust displacement hypothesis. Hap good proposed earth's outer crust could rapidly swift over its mantra drastically. This theory is sometime used to explain myth like Atlantis suggesting a physical mechanism for sudden land m land landmass ch changes.
(11:05) Current ge geological data shows no substantial evidence for rapid crustal displacement within the past 100,000 years and such a massive shift would require immense external force large uh like a large celestial impact. So my uh task is to carefully analyze this myth distinguishing between poetic narratives and possible scientific explanation.
(11:39) Moreover, this theory conflicts with the main base of geology, that is to say the continental drift and tectonic plate. Myth like Plats Atlantis might might hold fragments of shed ancient memory. Uh Plato describes Atlantis as an advanced civilization destroyed by floods. And this idea seems to align with the text of Edu, for example, the creation text which describe a primordial island and a devastating flood that scattered divine knowledge.
(12:16) The enigmatic emerald tablets attributed to Toth far further resonates with this describing a lost homeland. Despite uncertain origins, their content remind the plateau and net food text suggesting continuity of archetypal themes, destruction, survival, migration, and knowledge transmission. When considering myth of submerged lands like Atlantis, we must evaluate what cataclysm events could have caused such inundations.
(13:00) Largecale volcanic activity uh offer a plausible scenario. These events can unfold gradually enough for observation as some limited response aligning with myth where warnings and migration precede disaster. Therefore, for myths depicting warnings and migration before floods or land disappearance, prolonged ge geological events like significant volcano volcanic activity leading to tsunamis provide a more consistent framework for how such memories and warnings could have been preserved.
(13:44) Ancient texts often describe events resembling real historical occurrences hidden in symbolic language. For example, Headful Temple's descriptions detail an advanced civilization's downfall by catastroph. This prompts a key question key question. Could these accounts remind the same cataclysms found in myths of lost cont continents like Atlantis? And finally, consider thought to the Egyptian deity of wisdom.
(14:18) Could his arrival in ancient Egypt in the land of Cam symbolize a refugee for global catastrophs and the foundation for a new era of civilization? I propose a timeline for the event between 70,000 and 36,000 uh BCA blending myth with science. Now let's focus the last place sen marked by glacial activity and the toba super super volcano eruption created an stable environment.
(14:56) Figures like Todd and his followers may have immigrated to stable region like Cam, seeking a refugee and preserving knowledge from widespread destruction and in time it influenced the dynastic Egyptian myth. Following their integration, the major construction projects like the megalitic structures underneath the Giza plateau and the pyramids likely began.
(15:24) And this framework bridges ancient myth and scientific evidence offering a new perspective on our planet's ra history and past civilization's legacy. Some ancient texts seem and as myth might preserve distant memories of real historical events. For instance, the Edu text describe an advanced civilization destroyed by Kristoff.
(15:52) Do they point to a known culture striving between 75 and 70,000 before Christ, an era beyond conventional history? The myth of the arrival of Totten camp could symbolize the resettlement of survivors, custodians of lost knowledge who laid foundations for a new humano. In my opinion, that fragment of myth preserved ancient memories of historical transformations that shaped our ancient civilization.
(16:29) Could this be the era of gods among men in ancient Egypt guiding nomadic peoples to settled societies? What this when Aanti was built with its 12 sacred compartments as described in the Egyptian book of death. Furthermore, was this the epoch of the divine conflict between Osiris and Set culminating in the battle of Elopoulos and Set defeat.
(17:01) Mythological narrative like the book of death offer compelling answer. It recounts the war among the gods with set attacking Elopouolis for dominion. The gods defend the sacral land and this marks the beginning of the death tape the first time an epoch of divine presence and renewal. Central to this is the battle for the control over the shafts of Orus in Elopoulos where Ozirus transfers authority to Horus.
(17:34) But when all this happened, according to the Orion correlation theory uh that I believe is the one of the most important theory of the last decades proposed by Robert Bal because it is the first in my opinion scientific analysis of the ancient myth uh through um um advanced model of investigation, multiddisciplinary model of investigation.
(18:03) The OC anyway has limitation because it focuses only on the main Giza monuments potentially missing a global design and excludes alignment from more remote epoch like the zeppy othering to conventional human evolution timelines. What if these assumptions are incorrect? Bali Bvali identifies the spring equinox of 10,500 BC, the age of the lion as key due to the sphinx leon in apparencian connecting it to the Leo constellation.
(18:42) He also lines Orion's belt with the pyramid. While the basic principle are intriguing, his temporal calculation are in my opinion inaccurate. And here is why. According to me, we have to read the Giza plateau as a wall considering the monuments from east to west and south to uh north and now also from the uh underneath to the sky.
(19:15) That is why we must read the Ga Plateau as a global project. And in my opinion, there are also many other monuments that pyramids and sphinx that are integrated in the global project. For example, the the monuments in southeast of the Giza plateau where actually lies the master of the queen Kent Kawas and also the um the tomb of the birds that is in the west of the pyramids and I believe that belong to the global project also the temples beneath the pyramids.
(19:49) Now all those monuments connected them putting all those monuments together. I noted that each of them is has a connection with the sky. In the in uh this astronomical map we can see from east to west the connection that is to say the sphinx with the east and the temple beneath the sphinx are connected with two planets that are connected with regulus the star in the liar constellation and the planets are mercury and jupiter.
(20:24) The um also the pyramids are connected with the belt of Orion in this case precisely because Alita is correctly on the merinian in perpendicular to the great pyramid. So the main object of the Bertovan and of the monuments of the Gizau are connected and in the west the tombbo of the birds is in connection with uh constellation of Aquarius.
(20:52) This is a very interesting connection because as you know the bird tumba of the birds is characterized by large erosion water erosion and presence of sodium on the wall. It means that in the ancient past very likely it was a basin a water basin salt water basin to truly understand. So the Gizopra connection we can see in this image the connection between the monuments and the celestial world from east with the sphinx and the and the planets south the Orion constellation and west the Aquarius constellation.
(21:38) I'm convinced the pyramid were built uh during the dyn were were not built during the dynastic periods due to their unique architecture, block types and limited ancient tools. Crucially, no furerary remains or inscriptions have ever been found inside uh the great pyramid for example except the vice cart which only Zakya was claiming it's original.
(22:08) Furthermore, carbon 14 dating and organic artifacts from the Kofi pyramid show in consistent results suggesting uh that the lower part was built after the upper part. So also the C14 have failed to understand the purpose of the Giza complex. We must speak the same language of the builders and we must enter in the mind of the architects of Giza and speak their language.
(22:40) To do that the most effective approach is to explore primordial script integrated into the monument. used the number as a universal language transcending spacetime crucial for immortalizing the first time of the gods through monument alignment with celestial bis the astronomy also the geometry encoded through mathematical constants within the monuments from simple to complex forms and find the language of archetypes.
(23:12) The designer of Giza used archetype archetypal language to armatically transmit the lost civilizations scientific knowledge. Past attempts to apply scientific approaches like those on the pyramids of Cafre. Um uh there are lots of interesting uh elements that suggest the possible connection uh between the monuments and the uh phonetic language.
(23:44) Weing the Giza pyramids from above they look like wedges embedded in the sense now by drawing lines from the main pyramids to the queen's pyramid and from the queen's pyramid to the cardinal directions. A part emerged resembling a Mesopotamian Kuna form script. Comparing this geometrical configuration to the Sumerian syllary, a sequence of symbols G L Z become apparent interpreted as GU.
(24:22) It translate the great vice thought. This suggests a proof link between G um Giza's encoded knowledge and the mythical figure of thought. This finding challenges conventional views. Could Sumerian like scriptions exist within Giza, the earth of hieroglyphics? This might imply both writing systems arose from a common primordial sacred phonetic language.
(24:52) This study suggests Giza was an epicenter of a lost global language. A cosmic grammar expressed through architecture, astronomy and sacred symbol symbols. The uniform like elements may reflect a unified code preserved in stone by a civilization that understood the language's power. After exploring phonetic and astronomical insight, the investigation turned to the number, the tool of the universal language.
(25:29) Using prime factorization, I analyzed the great pyramids dimensions. Its height revolves to prime number seven and its base length to prime number 11. Seven represent cosmic order, compilation and spiritual perfection. 11 signify union, intuition, transcendence and intuition of into higher knowledge. Applying the prime factorization model to the pyramid of manower, its highest resolves to five and this base to 11.
(26:08) This non-coincidental repetition reinforces that the pyramids dimensions were intentionally encoded with the prime numbers serving as element keys in larger symbolic and mathematical language. The pyramid of caf surprisingly resolved to 137 for both its base and height using prime factorization. 137 is the inverse of the fine structure constant.
(26:41) A dimensionless number governing electromagnetic interaction in physics deeply significant to figure like Fman and Einstein but also PI and Max Leatherman. It connects electromagnetism, relativity and quantum mechanics. Cafris embodies 137 suggest a deliberate encoding of a fundamental universal truth.
(27:08) The code continues applying the primary counting function to the number 37. I obtain the number 33. This number significant in esoteric traditions breaks down into primes three and 11. It may embody the fine structure constant a bridge between macrocosm and microcosm and the map of inversion from physical to spiritual knowledge through the number 137 kaf pyramid becomes a gateway to the universe's architecture hinting that the ancients posted profound knowledge the number 137 derived from the pyramid of kafra holds multi-layered significance.
(27:54) its connection to the fine structures and beyond science 137 as esoteric resonance in Hebrew cabala the numerical value of a cabala itself 137 and archetypally 137 can signify entering the divine house of life and this suggests the monuments were designed as symbolic houses or conduits for specific knowledge. Let's examine the archetypal architecture of the pyramids focusing on the valley temple which consistently struck me as an electronic circuit board or microchip.
(28:46) I analyze its structures for um for the numerical codes. On the left there are three granite niche. Their inner colonate has 16 columns which numerologically reduce to seven 1 + 6. A final niche on the far left represents one. This composition ys 371 a n anagram of 137 a highly cious detail become be because we're dealing with archetypes I also looked for asinances the number three pecularity relates to the shin archetype transfigurative form where man is reincarnated alive the archetype originates from the Egyptian
(29:38) boat that transfigured the deceased into the realm of the gods. The number seven integrates with the towel archetype, meaning contemplation and creation. And finally, the number one perfectly integrates with the towel archetype do its form and meaning, the fulfillment of the entire revealed work of the god.
(30:05) Y 371 and not 100 137 in the valet sample. To decode this message, I apply the sigma function of all positive divisor is a formula applied to the 371 and the the results of this function applied the sigma function to 371 yields 432. The sig Significance of 432 earths lies in its natural resonance with human and cosmic fragrances.
(30:44) This suggests the valley temple temple through this code communicates a profound message immortality. The monument had arrived to understand the source from which these principles originated. 37 connected with spacetime and 432 linked to the concept of the eternal life. Now my attentions to uh focus to on the emerald tablets that I believe are really fundamental in all the reconstruction of the ancient myth even if the emerald tablets are very disputable content because it's was never found its original source.
(31:33) First to examine the physical description of the city of Amenum, any structures connected to it and second the phonetics described in the tablet 15 particularly stimulated my interest because in the 15 tablet there are lots of content that connects the divinity divinity the deity thought with the Giza plateau.
(31:59) That is why I believe that emerald tablets are very important also after the discoveries we made with the cafrey project. Now uh the academic view places the Giza pyramids in the old kingdom the fourth dynasty. Uh however, evidence suggests a far more ancient origins and their technical complexity and precision are inconsistent with the known fourth dynasty uh tools and knowledge.
(32:32) uh with the great pyramid the king's chamber feature massive granite blocks for example and extracting and working sard materials with this precision seems beyond dynastic Egyptian cap capabilities raising question about their builders technology farther water erosion marks on certain great pyramid sandstone blocks indicated prolonged exposure to significant rainfall or flooding As such weight conditions haven't existed in the Sara for millennia, hinting at a much earlier construction where the climate was different. These
(33:13) points collectively challenge conventional dating suggesting a sophisticated civilization predating dynastic Egyptians. I found anomalies inside the pyramids of Giza last March when I I made a mission on the Giza plateau particularly in the great pyramid and in the second pyramid of G the the so-called Cafra pyramid that raised significant question about the existence of unexplored passages suspicious architectural features such as irregularities in the great gallery.
(33:58) Uh the wall bit beneath the king chamber in 1980 for example and the unusual blocks within the horizontal shaft leading to the so-called belong chamber appear deliberately designed to conceal access to unknown spaces. In this context the use of synthetic aperture rad technology by the caf research project is of a critical importance.
(34:23) It enables researchers to see through solid stone structures and detect the geometric anomalies that may indicate hidden chambers. The diary of mirror part of the vad alra papiri is often cited as proof for the great pyramids for dynasty construction. This administrative record by overseer mirror details limestone transport from Turra to a site called Aet of Kufu interpreted by Egyptologists like Zagawas as the great pyramid around 2,400 before Christ.
(35:11) However, a critical analysis reveals flows. The papyrus never mentions pyramid terms that is mer aet meaning horizon is a broader cosmological term for a sag landscape not a physical ascending structures like a pyramid me or per mus. Therefore, Aket of Kufu likely refers to the Giza plateau as a sacred site, not specifically to the great pyramid.
(35:47) Awas and others reliance on me mirror's diary in a sematic misinterpretation equating acket with pyramid without explicit textual support. This linguistic lip props up the old kingdom hypothesis on contested ground. Thus, the Wadi Aljaf Papiri should be seen as a record of a broader royal works during Kufu's reign, not conclusive proof for the great pyramids construction date.
(36:24) Long before SA technology, scholars like Selma uh noted extensive subterranean structures at Giza. Uh moreover, Akima relying and indigenous knowledge spoke of a vast multi-level network of natural and medmade cavities beneath Giza. Andrew Collins re-examined historical counts focusing in areas like NC2 or Tumba of the birds in the west of the the Giza plateau and he proposed that apparent natural features are deliberate subterranean networks with architectural intent.
(37:08) This new data scientifically validates decades of speculation confirming Giza is a complex extending vertically into the earth as aan and colleagues insights now provide the crucial from framework for interpreting interpretating the ongoing revelation of the Giza underground. The connection between the Giza plateau and the mythological Amenti is a key research area.
(37:41) Amenti originally the goddess of the west can be linguistically translated as a seed or water of the divine power of life aligning with Egyptian cosmologist cosmologist link between rebirth and hidden divine energies. Ancient text associated the number 137 with the entrance into divine house of life. This suggests Giza isn't just a physical site but a itself a sacred place where life's divine mysteries converge.
(38:20) If these aren't just legories, Giza might hide more than monuments and it could be a multi-levelled integrated steam system designed to preserve cosmic knowledge. The Cafrey project SAR technology recently detected a large subfaces anomalies sign scientifically supporting this. Thus, Amenti might not only be a metaphysical real but a physical reality beneath Giza.
(38:53) The emerald tablet describe Amentis construction involving deep wells to bring light and life into it. This strongly resonates with Giza's archaeological landscape. Near the pyramids eastern and western necrop necropolises, numerous blocked vertical shafts exist, their depths unknown. It's possible these shafts linked to the mega structures recently detected by the s benius Giza.
(39:30) Thus, the ember tablets wells may be more than symbolic. They could be forgotten vertical access points connecting surface monuments to a hidden ancient underground complex. Ancient Egyptian civilization is defined by its intricate philosophy of duality seen in concepts like kimba or time such as ne or jet the linear and cyclical time and even dual cubit measurements within this the afterlife is is a dual real amanti the hidden land of rebirth and rostau giza plateau meaning entrance of the passages.
(40:17) Rostow likely denotes physical and metaphysical gateways linking the surface to a deeper concealed domain. Applying the aromatic axum as above so below a menty being underground mirrors Rostow. Similarly, the visible pyramids correspond symbolically to the duat mapped during the tape taping. Thus, Giza is more than a dual axum.
(40:48) Five minutes. Okay. It's a multi-dimensional interface containing connecting both a below earth and sky material and spiritual. This image illustrates as the as above so below principle connecting AI rosttow and duat with Egyptians co cosmologies birth death rebirth cycle to the east the sphinx guards threedimensional spirituality symbolizing birth and the rising sunward the pyramids signify the peak of human scientific ific and spiritual knowledge gained through earth earthly life.
(41:35) To the west, the tomb of the birds and underground entrance represent death, the passage to the invisible. The journey continues in Tamamenti through the 12 hours of the night as the as per the amuat a sacred space for body and soul regeneration preparing for rebirth. This rebirth occurs again in the east beneath the sphinx starting a new life cycle.
(42:09) This is Giza's profound mystery a sacred landscape encoding the eternal spiritual evolution through light, shadow, life, death, matter and spirit. My research challenges conventional Egyptology bridging bridging ancient myth and science. I propose the Giza pyramids are proof and instruments not just tomb linked to a nearly epoch as detail in 36,400 before Christ the secrets of the gods g with its deep subterranean structures testify to a primordial civilization of the gods.
(42:51) The civilization immigrating after global cataclysms like the Tuba Sova volcano eruption founded a new era based on advanced knowledge to be discovered. Thank you so much for your attentions. Yes, thanks a lot. Uh this evening I I am um give you this presentation which title is this the space honor. Uh this is the agenda that we are going to to see this evening.
(43:28) So there is a list of things and um unfortunately we have only 45 minutes so I have to speed up my presentation. Um and so we I describe the method that we used uh we use the vibration to uh perform the inside the scanning of the G of the Gabra. Uh I will show you approximately how the technique bond and how evolved from the laboratory into the space.
(44:02) uh I will give you some uh uh details about it and then we go inside the um the results on the on the Giza plateau. So um let's say synthetic a virtual rather is a rad that is um installed on board the satellites. The satellites are lower orbits. So they uh are flying um approximately 600 kilometers with respect to the earth surface.
(44:30) Uh they are capable to uh snapshot uh images from the earth and they work using electromagnetic pulses that are located inside the 10 GHz. So 3 cmters of wavelength using electromagnetic waves. uh let's see they uh the the the process of image for formation is divided into we have uh I'm sorry I I just want to take the the microphone so I tell you this uh we have uh first this is the raw data uh they collect uh electromagnetic impulses from uh the response of the earth and then we have two processing which has range which is range f
(45:24) focusing and azimut focusing. The range focusing is done by uh electromagnetic synthesis and uh the uh let's say range um uh resolution is proportional to the electromagnetic bandwidth that we are using. Instead the adimote resolution is proportional to the Doppler uh bandwidth and so uh the Doppler bandwidth is given because the satellite flies at a very high speed which is approximately 7 kilometers per second.
(46:00) So each target that is located located on the earth is uh located on the image according to its Doppler centroid like that. Here this is the target. So uh this is a synthetic aerture rather image that uh has been provide us by Capella space which is an American company. Uh this is the image representing the Giza plateau.
(46:30) Here we have the the three pyramids Kungu Cafra and the Mishino and so on. And we used uh according to uh the uh specific open arches policy of Capella space. We have used of course this is this image but also other image given by Umbra space which is an American company also and Cosmos Kim the second generation which is an Italian an Italian company.
(47:00) uh then uh so uh I just a brief a brief review uh of the state-of-the-art using synthetic a virtual radar. Uh here I show you uh the interferometric capabilities of synthetic a virtual radar when we are using two satellites. uh we can build up in the space an interferometer. And so according to the um to the coherent nature of electromagnetic waves, we are able to um analyze to analyze interferometric pattern here.
(47:36) This is the phase these are the phase fringes of the data. And so we can use this information to retrive topographic mapping. Uh we use topo topographic mapping in order to perform infrastructure monitoring. Uh so uh because uh inter interferometric procedures is is very efficient and very sensible because we are uh we are able to detect uh displacement of large infrastructure that are in the order of 1 millm.
(48:12) It means that that if the infra infrastructures move away or towards the sensors also if one of one mm uh the satellite is able to detect this movement. Uh yes, of course it is possible also to detect uh uh let's say crude oil extraction while we erh perform extraction of uh crude the oil pockets here.
(48:45) We extract material and of course the surface of the earth will perform a subsidance and this subsidance in terms of displacement it is possible to detect detect this movement from the earth. So this is just a brief description of the state-of-the-art of synthetic averure rather you can see that there are only uh super superficial interaction because we are using electromagnetic waves but what we did we did this according to the physics we can see that all the images are affected by movement it means that everything is moving and so it um uh it was possible to extract
(49:32) the so-called acoustic information from synthetic a virtual radar data. Uh this is here I show you uh two types of SAR data where we have special projection with erh high layover effect no layover effect but with for shortening here. So we can use a different projection of synthetic aure radar data.
(49:58) Erh what we did we did we we we h we uh have um development developed a technique in order to extract the acoustic information from data. Why? Because according to the image formation procedure it means that everything has to be without motion. If something moves with a certain um amplification, we can see the those movement on the image.
(50:31) So according to a procedure called Doppler subaberture um Doppler subaberture filtering, we have transformed a static image into a a live streaming inside the time of integration along the orbit which is approximately 15 seconds. According to this we have um uh we were a we was able to extract the acoustic information that belongs between zero to approximately 30 or 40 kHz.
(51:11) So we are uh performing a um let's say here a acoustic um listening of the earth inside this uh bandwidth which is the Doppler bandwidth. So we have let's say designed a a microphone where we have the satellite that um transmitting the light. So the electromagnetic frequency from the space will grab directly in terms of back scattering energy also the acoustic information.
(51:45) Why acoustics? Acoustics are very important because they are greedy of matter. acoustics are propagating all inside the matter and the more um the more is dense and the higher is the velocity of the erh acoustic waves. Erh yes our pat our um technique has been patent patented in Malta where is still active and we are proceeding a PCT so for an international application of the patent.
(52:21) Uh the first um the first experiments that we have done were to extrapolate the acoustic information from high voltage power grids. So we were able to listen by from uh from the space the ripple of the of the electric energy directly from space and so recording on uh this data on um uh on our disk. uh then uh we have moved into perform the so-called tomographic in inversion because the acoustic were grabbed from the earth and according to specific tomographic lines we were able to scan below the earth sorry if I if I am going
(53:09) a bit uh I if I am hurrying up because we don't have enough time to uh explain explain in detail each uh slides It's uh we start our experiments in laboratory where where here we have simulated we are simulating everything. So we have a sensor and so we have something that is vibrating and we choose it to uh to design a specific water.
(53:42) Um uh here we have water and so according to uh some movement here we were able to detect specific voids of erh located here and here. So these are the vibrations that we are uh we were uh recording from the top. And so this is the row data and then we have uh retrived the so-called FIA transform in order to uh rebuild the vibrational trend the vibrational um reconstruction of the table where the uh water was contained.
(54:27) And so we were able to make the picture from the top without seeing anything what was below of the table here. Sorry of the table here and the voids that were below the table here. This is just to show you that our technique bond from laboratory and then we move directly in space because because we have applied the same algorithms.
(55:01) Uh and we uh um performed the specific procedure in order to retrive the acoustic information watching the synthetic aerture analyzing or processing reprocessing synthetic aure radar data. We move it uh in United States where we ordered the specific erh SAR images. This is the car tunnel which is tunnel which is in uh United States in Nevada and here we have erh here we have erh railways that passes inside the tunnel.
(55:42) And so we erh worked in order to see what there was inside the mountain. Uh yes, here we have the tomog our tomographic results here and we are able to see the tunnel the tunnel that is passing inside the mountain here and here. This is the rather images are two other images of the uh the area the test area that we have done.
(56:13) Then we uh worked making other experiments and so we moved where I've born in in Italy in Lula uh where uh here we have the Grand Saso mountain which is nearly 3,000 m tall height of height and inside the mount the mountain there is a laboratory a physic physics laboratory where they study the neutrinos Uh this is the schematic representation of the laboratory that is inside the mountain.
(56:49) Uh yes, here we have a a tomographic reconstruction of the grand saso and we can see that we are detecting detecting the laboratory institutical nuclear and then also the a piece of the tunnel that goes that passes through the grand saso. Here we have a zoom. This is the the grandasol laboratory and this is the rep the schematic representation of the grandasol laboratory.
(57:26) So uh okay uh then uh we made other experiments. This is a dam uh this is the Mosul dam that is located in Iraq. uh where we have the optical satellite image and this is the synthetic aperture rather uh satellite image. We can see they are very similar but the bandwidth are completely different because the light is micron of wavelength and here we use electromagnetic waves 3 cm of wavelength.
(58:07) Uh yes uh the mosul dam was um there is inside the tunnel that passes longitudinally on the around um along the the dam. This is the inside picture of the tunnel and we have erh detected the longitudinal scanning of the of the of the muscle dam and here we are watching the tunnel. Okay, the picture of the tunnel here from here to here.
(58:42) Then we have detected also other uh facilities uh because here approximately here there are some uh fac electrical facilities uh which have we have designed here that are specific um generators here and this is the optical representation of that generators that we this that we have a picture using our technique like that.
(59:19) And then we have also here uh depicted also other facilities that are located this this and this inside the dam. [cough and clears throat] So uh and a last um experiment in order to validate the technique we did a lot of experiment experiments before to begin working inside the g the Giza plateau because we had we had to be sure that the technique was well tested.
(59:58) Uh so I show you this is the Sangotardo uh tunnel that is uh on the Alps in Switzerland. And then we have uh some features of the tunnels that are located below the earth. So inside the uh the the Alps, the Sangotardo mountain here and here like that. Okay. Then uh we started working at the Giza plateau and uh we for the first time we did some experiment in things that were known that we knew.
(1:00:43) And so this is the Osiris shaft. Uh the Osiris shaft is erh sorry. Okay. The osiris shaft is erh constituted by the uh three layers here. And we erh started we we made a processing technique uh of the osaris shaft and and here we have the representation of the osaris shaft. First layer, second layer and third layer.
(1:01:23) It is possible to see that the osiris shaft is not finished here because yes here here we have the water but below it there are other things and then go and they go deeper and deeper and deeper and we we are erh depicting also other things that are below the shaft. Okay. uh in um this we started this work in 2019 with professor Cororado Malanga and uh we were working in Italy on the Kum Kufu pyramid, the Kaops pyramid uh where here I I show you some experiments that we have published also.
(1:02:16) Uh here we have the chambers and uh it is very important to see this corridor here that is located behind the chevron here and we have detected also the corridor that is behind the chevron and this is the z that we have measured the fingerprint from the space. Yes. Uh these are the papers that we have erh erh published and uh this is uh erh mine my my paper together with Korad Malanga and this is the paper that erh professor Zakyawas published after after us.
(1:03:03) Okay. Now we move on uh on the um our project that we we have we are doing. We are working hard on the Giza plateau because we are erh scanning below the the Giza plateau in order to see what there is erh under erh this erh area. And so erh we started to erh the Cafrey pyramid. uh the Cafrey pyramid.
(1:03:35) Uh this is the erh tomographic reconstruction of the of the Cafrey pyramid. Here we can see that there are some facilities inside here. This this and this all these things uh we are erh accelerating to publish all these things. I think erh in two weeks the paper will be ready and you can you will see it in preprint on arceive and then in two weeks we will submit the paper in the peerreview journal erh remote sensing and so all these facilities that we are detecting here here here we are erh we erh have a lot of scans here in order to
(1:04:27) confirm what we are erh detecting. So the same things are detected detected and recognized to through different tomographic lines different erh SAR images and also different satellite systems. So that that is very important. And erh yes, here we have the the scan of the Cafrey pyramid. And so I I have to show you these things here that goes below the earth underneath.
(1:05:06) And we can see that they have something that can remember something that goes like that. here like that and this here like that. So they are like shafts. The shafts are erh connected to these structures here that are located erh located on the surface of the Cafrey pyramid. these structures and we can see that the shafts are connected through to the these things here.
(1:06:04) these facilities here and these facilities are have a a shape that can recall the so-called Jed the Z that is already present discovered inside the chaops pyramid. Okay. Uh here we have other images and we can see the shafts that goes underneath and here we have the the the cafra pyramid. What the things that that are inside the cafra pyramid.
(1:06:45) We have um um rised the the dimmer in order to make visible very visible the shafts. Okay, these are the shafts that are going underneath and here we are we have enormous structures that are located below. So the erh we have we have measured that from the top to the bottom maybe with erh a high very high probability one 1.2 kilometers.
(1:07:27) So they are very deep from here to here. And here I show you this is the Cafra pyramid. The shafts that are going below, here and here and here. And we can see that each shaft has a central core and they are like stairs, spirals that are going below like that. So erh the the distance that there is from the this is the datom.
(1:08:22) So this the zero the surface from here to here we have approximately 1.2 2 kilometers. And erh yes, I show you that. Uh so we have the shafts and then we have the shafts goes into some structures that are erh square square and the um the dimension of this structure structures are compatible comparable with the dimension of the pyramid.
(1:09:07) So they are very large. They're very big. And the shafts are encapsulated inside these structures. They are encapsulated. They go inside. Here we have the big room that we have on the bottom. Uh this is man also. Man has the shafts because we can see from the tomographic anal uh the tomographic results here.
(1:09:49) We analyze the shafts also. And also man here has a big room that is located underneath the same depthness 1.2 kilometers. We have measured the depness because of the particular configuration of the satellites. The satellites erh integrates the Doppler information in about 15 seconds. According to our software, we are able to measure precisely the depness.
(1:10:26) We measure the depth not in terms of distance but in terms of a delay. Then multiplying that delay. If we have the delay and we have a ge the geological composition of the matter we can measure the space. Okay. Erh uh we have recently performed an agumentation of our erh studies because now we are able to process also the polaric information of acoustics because we are measuring also the erh the polarization.
(1:11:22) So horizontal, vertical or oblique. So how the matter is vi vibrating with respect to a reference system let's say let's call the orientation of vibration and so we can erh collect this information this data and we can retrive also a from a black and white or let's say this image into a colored image This is man and we have also here the shafts.
(1:12:04) I show you different erh images because we have used the different satellites. So also changing the satellites we we are retriving the same results. That's that is crucial because we are intercepting the so-called academic and scientific method. Uh for the last I show you the sphinx. We made also some erh erh special erh process erh special um how you say investigation erh in order to see what there is below the sphinx.
(1:12:44) And here we found the same thing. So a a shaft only one shaft here that is going to a room and then goes below to a second room. So we have two rooms here. The first one and the second one. Here this and this. This is another orientation of the sphinx. And so we are now ready to erh build a three-dimensional model of what we have found. This is the cafre pyramid.
(1:13:32) We pass from the pyramid to the measurements and from the measurements to the 3D model. The 3D model is was made by humans. Me and Colorado and Armando made the 3D model, not in artificial intelligence. And so we have the rooms, the rooms, the shafts, the shafts, and on the top there is the pyramid.
(1:14:09) uh the erh distance between the surface and the rooms are not in scale. It means that is not in scale because if if was in scale it had it erh could be very long. Okay. So it's only a reference a reference that we did that we put. Yes. I don't know how how much time I have. Uh thanks to Trevor Graassi that is erh present here. [applause] Five minutes. Okay. Thank you.
(1:14:56) It's not my work. This is not my work but erh of Trevor. We um we are now showing erh the erh shafts that are visible from the surface of Giza and we have erh erh designed the three specific areas where there are present a lot of shafts. So erh we wanted to know erh more about these shafts here and erh we have concentrated on one shaft on this shaft.
(1:15:35) >> 15 15. Thank you. on this shaft here where we have this shaft the we performed the study on the on this shaft here and we have the tomographic analysis of what there is underneath. So this is the tomographic projection of this shaft where we are watching the shaft from the top. Okay. So we have a section of the shaft The shaft is here we have the height and the tomographic line.
(1:16:16) So it's like a vertical cain that you have below and underneath. So, so we can understand that there is a room very clear here and inside the room is present. There are present things. So, we can also observe what there is inside the room. There are targets. It's not empty the room and erh this erh sha the most of these shafts are blocked on a certain depth that is some meters.
(1:17:06) So in my personal opinion, these shafts can be easily cleaned and can be a an entrance to go in the city that it it is located below. So it is very simple without digging anywhere. We just do the correct manot manutension manotension of the shafts. We clean the shaft the shafts and we can access inside the underneath word that there is here and we can arrive to this chamber here and we we are seeing we are watching that the chamber is not empty.
(1:18:00) is full of things. So, erh this is the 3D model that we have development developed to together with Colorado Malanga. And this is my last erh slide. I show you I leave I leave the 3D model of the Gavl. Thank you. If you have if you have questions, we are here. questions
(1:19:06) right there. >> Can Michael Donan come up for some translation? your question again, folks. I'm sorry. Yes. What we observe are is the energy of vibration. Okay. Yes. Usually where you see dark is void. Where you see bright is dance. Okay. That's that's the basic rule of interpretation. Okay, >> sir.
(1:20:27) This is just the 3D model and the they are we are showing the walls not transparent. It's not a block of erh things. These are empty. Yes. your question. I'm sorry. Yes, we are to we are looking the walls
(1:21:34) because the walls are very sensible in vibrations. Yes. I I tell you if so you have an empty block. Okay. When you perform the acoustic erh the Doppler tomography of an empty an empty block that is underneath you see the boundaries of the block because they resonate they do like a membran they resonate. Okay.
(1:22:21) If there is something inside connected to the to the ground of the empty chamber will resonate with everything and you will see it from the top has to be connected like that. Okay. kilos empty. >> Ah okay. Yes. Yes. In my personal opinion, in our personal opinion are absolutely not natural because you saw spiral nature of the evolution of the
(1:23:25) tomographies. So something like that regular you you you have seen regularity erh 90 degree um variations of the boundaries. So those are fingerprints that with high probability can be anthropic not natural in our personal opinion. >> I show you. See there is the water table. Yes. Look here. I show you. very bright, very bright, very bright.
(1:24:12) Then the energy abruptly decreases abruptly. It means that there is something that decades the energy that we are that we are re revealing from the top and that could be the water table. Okay. Yes. >> How large are the shafts? How large are the rooms? >> Yes. 20 mters. >> And the rooms? >> 80 mters. >> 20 and 80. Thank you.
(1:25:06) >> Yes. My husband is Robert Shock and I have a question because we were in the Osiris shaft and when we descended we found lines of vitrification which we think relate to Robert's research regarding the sun exploding at the end of the ice age and ending this high cycle of civilization. So of course the sun being raw, the high god raw.
(1:25:35) Do you think it is possible that these are lines of vitrification and that they were trying to follow in essence the the fingerprints if you will of God of raw vitrification? >> I hope that made sense. >> Did that make sense to anybody? I am I'm sorry but I am not an expert in this. I can't give you the answer because I am not expert.
(1:26:30) We are just measuring the acoustic fingerprint of the osari shaft. The the technique is not so precise in order to define vrification or other kind of erh physical phenomena that erh can be retrived underneath. So I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know. Yes. Is the technique sensitive enough? Oh, is the technique sensitive enough to distinguish between different types of rocks? So, could you classify say different geologies? >> Yes, thank you very much for this question that is related to the previous question.
(1:27:16) So, I give you the answer to both. uh we are working in order to make agumentation of our technique in order to try try and guess to guess try and guess erh different types of material. Why? Because this technique yes we are we are using this technique on Giza but can be used also for mining no for erh oil extraction or other things.
(1:27:53) So yes we are working on this. Why? Because inside the Doppler bandwidth we can we can try to using signal processing procedures to extract features that may let us understand different types of material. Okay. >> Do you see this being used erh in the future for commercial purposes such as subsurface surveys? for now not because we are working on Giza plateau.
(1:28:29) We are concentrating energy on Giza but in 2026 I think Gmando the the project Yes. We had a lot of requests from the commercial side but they are all in standby. We had a lot of a lot of erh erh a lot of requests with Armando. We worked on those quiz but they are frozen for the moment. Now we are doing philanthropic activities on Giza.
(1:29:08) So no no profit but it is possible to you (1:29:32) to use it on on the commercial side especially for mining and oil extraction. Okay. Yes, thank you for this question. This is another thing that we are working on. I tell you to have a slice because the the algorithm the algorithm is highly computational. erh demanding to do one slice.
(1:29:55) I employ at the moment using a 45 core computer. So very powerful three weeks at the moment. I'm sorry. So your request is as a sense in order to make several scanners. For the moment we have to we have this then in the future we are moving the software into GPU from CPU to GPU. Let's say let's see if something will if we gain some time in terms of computational effort. Thank you.
(1:30:37) Yes, we have. >> If you could go back to the Giza plateau, the the the graphic of the Giza plateau. I just wanted to ask a question on >> the plate. G. >> So my my first question was are all the boxes at the same roughly the same elevation 1.2 2 km. >> I I fetch the image of the GLL. This >> the the next the graphic the >> the graphic this Yes.
(1:31:16) >> or or Okay. >> Are are roughly are all the the boxes roughly at the same elevation 1.2 km. >> Yes. So, is it do you think it's possible because you're just doing specific scans of areas that they're not boxes that it's like they're continuous? >> Maybe possible, but I tell you at least the boxes concerning the main pyramids has sense that are at the same wall depth. Yes.
(1:31:49) >> But it's possible it could be a bigger area. >> Yes. These may be no but we are working on it. >> Okay. >> Thank you. >> One more. One more. This gentleman right here. >> Do you guys know if there's any kind of magnetic anomalies? Uh >> do you guys know if there's any kind of magnetic erh anomalies along with the temples here? Because seems that a lot of the megalithic structures do have some kind of magnetic erh resonance to it. about magnetic anomalies.
(1:32:25) The physical parameter of magnetism is completely discharged from the physical parameter concerning the acoustic entropy. So we are not able to detect magnetism processing acoustic information because they are different. they don't interact together maybe indirectly but at the moment I can give you an answer I tell you in this moment we are erh collaborating with Stanford with professor Howard Zeper of Stanford which is a full professor of synthetic aperture radar maybe we will do other things that we will show the next
(1:33:12) conferences Yes. So I know that this takes a lot of um erh computing time and erh so I did some research erh and there's a lot of erh freely available distributed computing apps that we could all volunteer to put on our computers and get our friends to put on our computers so that hey let's leave the laptop on for lunch so Filippo can do some erh data crunching erh across our distributed global network on our computers.
(1:33:53) Uh I, you know, don't know if that would be practical for you, but it's there's four or five and some other open source and it's very secure and erh it it's philanthropic work and I think we'd all like to help. >> Yes, can be done of course in the future. At the moment, we have the beyond the computer that is in his house. [laughter] >> Okay, I think that's it for questions.
(1:34:22) Philip, I had a question. Um, it's tough to make big claims in front of a skeptical world and there are a lot of skeptics out there. You've caught a lot of grief and taken some shade from even people in our community. Um, how have you dealt with it? Has it deterred you at all or made you more determined? What's it like being the subject of erh people thinking that you're somehow deliberately misleading someone? >> I am in a mess.
(1:34:58) I don't Yes. To the this skepticism is normal and I accept it because erh we are here and I accept it. Uh but I tell you criticism came not from the academic position not from the academic world who studied who studies now synthetic aperture radar. I am 25 25 years that I process image. So erh we are a community of erh 100 people that use that erh that in all in all the world that studies synthetic virtual radar.
(1:35:43) Zero comments on my colleagues. [applause] >> Well, good afternoon. I I do have a question with erh the research that you've been doing. Have erh you calibrated in with the hydraulic pulse generator that is actually in part of the subterranean chamber underneath the pyramid of Giza and the frequencies that are generated from that into your calibrations.
(1:36:44) Can you please repeat the question? >> Can you please repeat the question? >> Okay. U the the subtraining chamber John Cadman's work that >> whose work Christ >> John Cadman >> John Cadman >> John Cadman >> Okay. Yeah, I know because he's my brother. I've been erh deal working in his research for the last 25 years and we have the working model of the subterranean chamber hydraulic pulse generator and he it's in Chris Dunn's new book.
(1:37:22) >> So it's a it's a hydraulic pulse generator which creates frequencies. >> Okay. >> And vibrations. And has that been calculated into your research? Yes, if we are open to any kind of collaboration. If this research group erh erh will join us, we we can exchange erh technical information with them. Why not? we will erh maybe collaborate with them. Yes.
(1:38:05) >> Yeah, that'd be great. >> Okay. >> Thank you very much, doctors Beyond and May. Let's have a vigorous round of applause and appreciation for these gentlemen's work. >> Next up will be Hugh Newman at 3:30. Come on back for Hugh Newman. It's going to be something else.
