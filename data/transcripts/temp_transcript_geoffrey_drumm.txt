(00:05) [Music] Okay. So, what you were just saying is, you know, the barrier of entry. >> Yeah. >> And how it can be very, very difficult for people to get engaged in this hypothesis. Yes. Because it requires so much investment in understanding it. And that's why I preface what we've done thus far regarding the Egyptian pyramids with the foundation of supporting evidence that shows the evolution and development of the technology coming from point A in stone circles to Egyptian pyramids with all of the same knowledge applying to the function of
(00:39) all of the structures. And of course we can do short overviews of these things but the function of ancient technology should be a complex in-depth discussion and I take it as a great compliment that you know it takes a long time on these podcasts to get through all of the information and all the research. >> Mhm. Yeah. No, it does.
(01:01) Like yeah the barrier and entry thing is um the biggest thing for me which is like >> it's a double-edged sword. >> Sure. >> Right. because it might be harder for something like this to go viral on the internet or something like that or to make a really [ __ ] fascinating like clip about like oh my god this is crazy I got to share it you have to really [ __ ] dive in >> to everything and it's going to take hours to really understand it to make it click and to like then you zoom out and you're like holy [ __ ] this makes the
(01:31) most sense >> like this really does make the most sense >> and in my opinion I take that as a compliment it's how it should be >> this is not simple technology. >> This is not something that you're going to be able to download on a Tik Tok video. >> It's the evolution over thousands of years of deep understanding of the forces of nature, physics, and chemistry that resulted in the development of the most complex >> type one civilization technology that we see on the planet. Mhm.
(01:59) >> Their mastery of the forces and cycles of nature from the power source to the physics to the chemistry is something that's almost beyond our comprehension. >> Mhm. >> And like Steve was saying, he was like, you know, why don't you make that model out of steel. >> Instead of using plexiglass, use steel. That's exactly what Fritz Habber did is he took the engineering of the red pyramid and instead of using plexiglass or stone he used steel reaction chambers which led us to the development of the habber process and the modern
(02:33) manufacturing of ammonia that we have today >> is by using steel reaction chambers the same shape though right >> it was you know it's the same physics they're cylinders >> but you're still using >> the manipul of temperature and pressure and pressurized gas and electrical current to drive these chemical reactions.
(02:56) So that's exactly what he did is the same idea that Steve had is like instead of making a model out of stone or plexiglass, why don't we make it smaller out of steel? Mhm. And >> that's exactly what Fritz Haber did is build that small apparatus with the exact same configuration of the red pyramid which led to our modern industrial scale ammonia manufacturing.
(03:17) The exact same thing that we just saw. >> Right? >> So we're going to breeze through the bent pyramid. >> Okay. >> I'm just going to kind of comment on the process where they're using the carbon dioxide byproduct of the red pyramid and the aquous ammonia solution to produce ura. primary application being for fertilizer.
(03:38) I've also proposed an alternative hypothesis for the function of the bent pyramid for the production of nitric acid >> which again when you combine nitric acid with hydrochloric acid you can produce aqua regia the only well one of the only aquous chemicals that can dissolve gold. So it always goes back to gold and the processing of gold ore and the separation of pure gold.
(04:02) So here I'll run through the animations on the function of the bent pyramid just so you can see that the same mechanisms of operation apply to the function of the bent pyramid that also apply to the red pyramid. So we had the carbon dioxide byproduct that was being produced in the manufacturing sequence in the red pyramid that is introduced into the reaction chambers along with the aquous ammonia solution to produce ura with the satellite pyramid being a hydraulic press that controls the operation of the stone valves within the bent pyramid. So
(04:34) here we have the filling process filling the primary reactor with aquous ammonia introducing the carbon dioxide which produces a chemical reaction that generates either ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate depending on the temperature and pressure conditions. I won't get into the weeds on that right now.
(04:51) >> Okay. >> So we're filling it introducing the gas creating ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate. Next sequence is activating the pump shafts to introduce more water into the facility. The exact same mechanisms of operation that we just saw in the red pyramid where water from the reservoir was introduced into these pump shafts and the pump shafts were utilized to manipulate the water level within the chambers.
(05:20) So you have a solid compound that's developing inside the primary reaction chamber. The only way to redesolve that is by introducing more water into the reactor, which is where the water from the reservoir comes into play. The water from the reservoir is introduced into the lower chamber system. It will fill the northern pump shaft.
(05:42) That pump shaft is activated to press more water into the connecting passage. >> That water will then fill the western pump shaft. Then the western pump shaft is activated to pump more water into the primary reactor to dissolve the solid compound and the whole thing is extracted through the lower separation chamber system. >> Okay, >> so here's kind of an animation showing the function of the bent pyramid.
(06:02) If anyone wants to go more in depth on any of these topics, check out my YouTube channel. >> Perfect. >> Okay, the great pyramid. So, we talked about at the beginning of the episode how if we were to travel to an extraterrestrial planet, >> yes, >> the moon, the Mars, or an asteroid. >> Uhhuh. >> The first >> Atlas, >> the first thing that we would do is build in situ chemical manufacturing and mining facilities.
(06:32) This is a paper talking about the proposed silicut sulfuric acid process mineral processing for insitu resource utilization. That's been the whole topic of this overall podcast is utilizing insitue natural resources for producing chemicals for metallurgical applications. >> Insichu mean >> on site. >> Okay. So this is a paper.
(06:57) The abstract is volatile elements and compounds found in extraterrestrial environments are often the target of insitu resource utilization studies. Um and long story short, this is saying that we would want to build a facility on an extraterrestrial planet that could exploit sulfur resources >> for the extraction of iron metal and the production of metals >> on site.
(07:25) This is exactly what the Great Pyramid was designed to do. >> This was from what you Okay. Uh Curtain University, >> correct? Yeah. The Space Science and Technology Center. So, this is just kind of entertaining the idea >> that again I don't buy into this that the Great Pyramid or any of the pyramids or any of this ancient structures around the world were built by extraterrestrials. Mhm.
(07:47) >> But if we were traveling to an extraterrestrial planet, >> we're already hypothesizing how we would extract minerals and create >> correct manufacturic acid manufacturing facility that utilizes extraterrestrial sulfur sources for these metallurgical processes. And this is almost verbatim exactly what was happening inside of the Great Pyramid where the Great Pyramid is built on top of a local source of sulfur for creating sulfuric acid for mining and metallurgical processes.
(08:24) >> See, that's all you had to do to sell it. Just a little dab, just a little cherry, >> little dab, a little alien cherry on top. Yeah. So, again, I don't I don't buy into that, >> right? I think that these were built by human beings, but I think it's fun to entertain these alternative hypotheses because again, there's a lot of rhetoric and mythology about extraterrestrials coming to the planet for mining gold.
(08:46) Specifically with the Anunnaki topic, again, I don't really buy into that. I think these are made by humans. But >> if humans were going to other planets, you don't build bring the stuff, you build it on site. >> That's exactly what we would do. creating sulfuric acid for metallurgy and mining applications.
(09:06) Okay, so let's dive into the function of the great pyramid. We're going to walk through the function of each chamber individually and I'll also discuss what is really below the Giza plateau. A natural cave and tunnel system and hydrothermal vents that created these iron oxide deposits and the source of the hydrogen sulfide that was utilized within the Great Pyramid to produce sulfuric acid.
(09:32) Mhm. >> Okay. So why would you create sulfuric acid? Mostly for metallurgical processes, >> right? So you can also make fertilizers, petroleum refining, metal processing. All of these applications that we've talked about across the board apply to sulfuric acid as a product of the Great Pyramid.
(09:56) Again, the product is not electricity. The product is chemicals. sulfuric acid specifically inside the Great Pyramid that can be utilized for processes like leech mining and the separation of metals. So this is a diagram from a paper that I'm about to present showing the natural cave and tunnel system below the Giza plateau below the Giza pyramids that also includes you see these big vertical features.
(10:25) >> Yeah. These hydrothermal vents that are from the ancient Tethus seafloor, hydrothermal vents can extend into the bedrock for kilometers. They are extremely deep vertical features that are a natural part of the limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau that are a part of this ancient seafloor. These hydrothermal processes are what created the iron veins on the Giza plateau.
(10:53) These deposits of iron metal were created by hydrothermal vents on the ancient Tethus seafloor that created the limestone bedrock of the Giza Plateau. >> Whoa. Okay. Sulfur directly under the pyramids. >> Directly below the pyramids. And I'm going to show you a paper that corroborates that talking about hydrothermal vent systems.
(11:16) >> Did you show this to your boy? >> Who? >> The Filipo guy. >> Oh, no. So they don't they I don't know that they know about this yet >> because this is a fairly recent discovery for me. >> I found this paper probably within the past 6 months. Okay. >> My original hypothesis for the s source of the sulfur is basically what we're talking about here is sulfur mining in Egypt.
(11:40) They were mining sulfur in ancient Egypt. That's a well doumented process. And they were using the sulfur for a variety of applications from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals. and they know where they were mining these things. For example, Gel Elzite, as I mentioned before, is one of the mining locations. Um, no, that's Wad and Eleras, which is kind of close to here.
(11:59) But they had specific mining areas uh close to the um Suez Canal that were the mining locations for native sulfur, like elemental sulfur. It wasn't until much later that I found this paper that supported the idea that there were actually sulfide deposits directly below the Giza pyramids. sulfide deposits. >> Yeah, specifically hydrogen sulfide gas.
(12:20) Now, they could have been extracting this sulfur using a process that is reminiscent of our modern-day fresh process, which is again pumping hot water into these sulfide deposits. Very similar to the process that was utilized in the step pyramid for the extraction of bedrock methane. >> Okay.
(12:43) So raw materials, we have talked about the Egyptian pyramids harnessing raw materials and utilizing those raw materials that are abundant resources of the earth for a variety of different manufacturing processes. So we have sulfur, air, water and methane. Again, step pyramid extracting bedrock deposits of methane.
(13:06) The sarapium converting air into hydrogen and oxygen. The red pyramid converting hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia and the great pyramid transforming sulfur and air into sulfur triioxide and dilute sulfuric acid. Okay, so the configuration of the king's chamber. There is a shaft system below the king's chamber.
(13:30) Shout out Matt Simpson from Ancient Architects recently did a video about this showing the shaft system below the king's chamber. That is the inlet for the hydrogen sulfide gas that was being introduced into the reactor. Same thing as we had here in the bottom of the final reaction chamber of the red pyramid, the final synthesis chamber, there was a shaft.
(13:52) That's why they excavated out all the stone from inside of the final synthesis chamber of the red pyramid. They were following that shaft. >> And what went in that shaft shaft? >> It's the extraction of the product. The aqua ammonia was being extracted out of that shaft system. I see. >> So there is a hole, a shaft in the bottom of the chamber telling me about this.
(14:12) >> Yeah. Yeah. They excavated down in this thing and they just found that it was filled with rubble and debris. So they abandoned the excavation. >> Mhm. >> This is the inlet shaft that was used. >> The extraction shaft of the Red Pyramid. There has to be a reason that they excavated the entire floor of the final synthesis chamber and removed all of that material.
(18:19) There's a giant pit in there now. >> So, we don't know what the original configuration of this final synthesis chamber was. >> So, in my opinion, they were following the extraction shaft >> and they excavated all that material in search of the feronic burial and treasure, >> right? But all they found again was that it was filled in with material.
(18:41) >> Got it. >> So it was abandoned. >> I see. >> This is again my hypothesis about this shaft below the king's chamber which went down further but it was filled with material already.
(20:51) So like the hypogum or hypogenic okay means formation from below. >> Okay. >> Okay. So these are some images of sulfuric speliogenetic hypogene cave systems. It's a very complicated geological term for cave systems that form as a result of sulfuric acid. >> These are in Austria. These are just sulfuric acid caves.
(21:23) Okay, you see these formations? >> This is exactly what they find all over the Giza plateau are formations that look exactly like this. These are my pictures from an area adjacent to the Great Pyramid. You can see there on the left, this geological formation. It's the end of a tunnel that goes down into the bedrock. >> That the one on the left, >> the one on the left >> is where is specifically where? So this is adjacent to the Great Pyramid in an area known as the trial passages.
(21:50) Okay? And it's a tunnel going down into the bedrock that is connected into this cave and tunnel system below Giza. >> You can see this is the exact type of formation that we have here. >> Yeah. >> These sulfuric acid cave systems that form in bedrock. >> Here on the right is an area called the tomb of the birds.
(22:11) Have you heard about this? >> No. Um, again, shout out Hugh Newman and Andrew Collins. This is one of the primary entrances into the subterranean cave and tunnel network below Giza, the tomb of the birds. And I've been down inside of it, and you see all this red material. It's all iron ore. >> Okay, here's a paper.
(22:38) Hypogene caves in uh hypogen cave patterns in iron ore caves. This is exactly what we have below the Giza plateau is a subterranean cave system that is permeated with iron ore deposits. So this whole paper talks about spelioenesis which is a word that means cave formation. >> Okay. >> So spelioenesis in iron ore caves. This is exactly what we have on the Giza Plateau.
(23:11) >> We have iron ore in those caves. >> This is it right here. This is a picture inside the tomb of the birds, which is an opening. You can see it on the left, too. All of this material is permeated with iron ore all across the Giza Plateau. >> Okay. The whole cave system inside the tomb of the birds, which is a tunnel that leads down into the bedrock of the Giza Plateau, is filled with iron ore.
(24:22) >> Okay. >> Okay. So the development of sulfuric acid, speliogenetic deposits within cavernous middle eosene beds and inference on hydrocarbon gas seepages. Giza pyramids plateau Egypt. So very complicated geological nomenclature X-ray fluorescent analysis. So we we'll get into so the synopsis of this paper >> yes >> is that there are hydrocarbon deposits >> so we're talking about methane gas >> and the gas seepages that led to the development of the step pyramid and the extraction of methane methane is a hydrocarbon this paper is corroborating the presence of these hydrocarbon gas seepages below
(25:15) the pyramid complexes of lower Egypt. >> Specifically on the Giza Plateau, they have hydrogen sulfide coming up from these caves. >> Oh my gosh. I I I found the same thing Googling it. >> Yeah, it is. >> Yeah. So, again, yes, scientific research has suggested that natural sulfuric acid spelioenesis cave formation has occurred within the limestone bedrock of the Giza Plateau.
(25:45) >> Wow. This is linked historically to hydrocarbon gas seepages from deeper subsurface reservoirs below the plateau. This is monumental in understanding the function of the Giza plateau chemical manufacturing complex. Which is again why I preface this whole discussion with research evidence that there's a connection between subterranean gas resources, metal ore deposits, touric currents, lightning strike locations, and natural gas reserves.
(26:19) Everything coming to the culmination on the construction of the Giza plateau. The apex execution of this natural resource utilization and optimization technology.
(28:40) So they took chemical analysis of samples all over the Giza plateau and they found a variety of metal compounds. The metal compounds that they found in their chemical analysis matches the chemical analysis data that the Acida project has in their samples from the iron ore deposits. So again, this paper is corroborating the existence of these metal ore formations on the Giza plateau and also corroborating the chemical analysis data that has all of these variety of metals.
(29:16) Again, this is me standing in a huge metal ore deposit adjacent to the central pyramid. >> These iron ore formations, you cannot take one step on the Giza plateau without stepping over an iron vein. Wow. >> And I have a map of this that I'll show you in just a minute. This is me down inside one of these carsted formations >> that is connected to the quote unquote boat pits on the eastern side of the central pyramid.
(30:46) Understanding the ancient geology of the Giza plateau and the natural resources that it contains are essential to understanding the impetus in the operation of the pyramid complex. So they go vertical. Correct. Hydrothermal vents are huge vertical features in the bedrock where this ore material was being forced up by the hot water and deposited into the limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau hundreds of millions of years ago. Teeth sea.
(31:46) That deposited these iron veins and iron ore deposits all over the Giza plateau and the natural carst cave and tunnel system. >> Fascinating. >> This is another depiction of that same process with this hydrogen sulfide gas coming from subterranean acidic groundwater below the Giza Plateau. This is exactly what we talked about in the operation of the step pyramid >> being built on top of these hydrocarbon deposits and extracting bedrock deposits of methane.
(32:37) >> Wow. Again, I thought my original hypothesis was that they were extracting and mining elemental sulfur because we know that they were mining sulfur in Egypt and that that sulfur was heated to release sulfur dioxide. >> Mhm. >> That's how we do it today. >> Right. >> In the modern contact process, we introduce air and sulfur into a burner and they heat it. Yeah.
(33:01) >> To react the sulfur and the oxygen to create sulfur dioxide. >> Essentially burning raw elemental sulfur. That was my original hypothesis. When I discovered this, it it was unbelievably grounds shattering, like earthshattering that there's actually the source of sulfur directly below. They didn't need to mine the sulfur.
(33:27) It came directly from below the pyramids. >> Oh, dude. which it linked all of my other hypotheses about the exploitation of natural resources. Everything came together when I discovered this paper.
(34:14) And the process also involves a heat exchanger, which is my hypothesis for the big void above the grand gallery. It's a it's a heat exchanger >> for removing some of the heat energy from this extremely exothermic reaction and it's in the perfect location for a heat exchanger component. >> Okay, so here we have diagram of the king's chamber with the sulfur dioxide inlet shaft.
(35:27) >> Okay, >> brings everything together in the function of the great pyramid. So, go back to that last one. So, what is the blue stuff coming in? Coming in. That's water coming in through the bottom. >> Yeah. So, this is actually I I'll have an animation of this here in just a second that that describes the process.
(35:48) Okay. >> That So, the big void. >> Yes. >> We don't know what it is yet. >> Right. >> There's an exploration coming up in 2026 where they're going to be investigating the northern shaft inside of the Queen's Chamber and also exploring the Big Void. >> Which one's the northern one? The one on the right. Yes.
(36:07) Coming from the queen's chamber, the northern shaft is the one on the right, >> and it goes next to the Grand Gallery. >> Correct. >> Okay. >> Yeah. And then the void is just a big empty space. We don't know what's in there. >> The size of a of a of a passenger jet, right? >> It's said to be the similar size to the Grand Gallery.
(45:03) >> Yes. when it comes down when the water level is lowered. Correct? It is a syringe. So, if you look, if you were to put that vertically, it wouldn't connect to the king's chamber and you wouldn't be able to effectively draw any air into the system. If it was horizontal, you wouldn't have enough time in the water lowering process to effectively draw air through the air intake shafts, pulling it into the Grand Gallery.
(46:19) >> Correct. >> So it's already so so the sulfur dioxide is already in the king's chamber and then the water is acting as pressure uh like a reverse syringe to suck the gas out of the king's chamber back down into the grand gallery.
(56:24) The product of the Great Pyramid is dilute sulfuric acid, >> which was used for what again? >> Metallergy, mining, all of these. >> And where did it go? It went into where where did they collect it all? >> So, we'll talk about that just in a second. Where where does it go? Yeah. >> And where was it collected? and the function of the entire Giza plateau as an integrated metallurgical and metal ore extraction facility.
(57:16) >> Was this corroboration is this uh known to the public or is this like a secret he told you? >> It's known within the alternative community and he said it three times and I have it on video from a tour where he >> And is this heresy to people in the uh antiquities administration? >> No, no, no.
(59:11) Inverse pazoelectric effect. So I've mentioned this a couple of times that when you apply voltage to a quartz crystal it produces ultrasound vibrations. This is the exact opposite of the pazo electric effect where you have mechanical compression of a quartz crystal. >> Yeah. >> That produces voltage.
