(1:47:32) >> Got it. >> Of the structure. >> I see. >> Okay. So, this is why it's super important to understand the known configuration and compare it to their raw scan data. >> Mhm. >> Okay. So what they're saying here is they cannot detect the known chambers in limestone bedrock because there the limestone bedrock absorbs the radar signal.
(1:48:00) >> Ah right. >> Okay. These chambers are at a depth of no more than 15 meters in limestone bedrock. >> What's that defeat? So they can't detect known chambers that are excavated in bedrock, the same bedrock that's all over the Giza Plateau. >> Yes, >> they can't detect something in 15 m of bedrock because the limestone absorbs the signal.
(1:48:31) >> What is 15 m to feet? I'm an idiot when it comes to the translation. >> So 45 ft. >> 45 ft. Okay. So these chambers underneath the middle pyramid are roughly 45 ft >> into the bedrock. Correct. >> And it's not showing on their scan. >> Correct. >> Okay. Got it. >> Their explanation for this is because this limestone quote absorbs the signal.
(1:48:54) >> Yep. This is a huge issue. How can they detect something that is a kilometer in the same bedrock if they can't detect what we know is there in 15 m of bedrock? Maybe maybe the chambers are too small. The chambers that they detected in the Great Pyramid, for example, I'll go through their Great Pyramid scans, okay? And I'll show that they were able to on occasion detect the queen's chamber.
(1:49:31) >> Mhm. >> Which is smaller than the primary chamber inside the central pyramid. >> Okay. >> So they were able to detect small chambers. >> Interesting. >> All right. What do we got? >> So again, I'm just presenting the data that they have shown us now. >> Yes. Got it. And as somebody whose basically entire life is focused on the known configuration of these chambers, if you're coming to the table with a new technology that cannot detect what we know is there, >> how is this a viable technology for detecting stuff that we don't know is
(1:50:08) there? >> Did you did you ask Fippo about this? >> 100%. What did he say? >> It's on camera in both my Malta conference video and Jay Anderson. Shout out Jay Project Unity. We both filmed the whole conference. >> Yeah. >> And I asked Filippo a number of times about these detection issues. His answer, I don't know.
(1:50:29) >> Which was an honest answer. >> Yes. >> And it's a mark of his integrity. Yes. >> And his honesty to say if you ask me a question about the function of the pyramids, >> don't try to make some [ __ ] up. I >> I will tell you I don't know. And there's been a number of times in this >> conversation he's being honest. Right.
(1:50:44) >> When I've said that, I don't know. I would never claim to have all the answers. Totally. And again, I'm not trying to debunk this. >> Mhm. >> But there's some big problems, >> this being number one, >> them saying directly quoting that the radar is absorbed in this limestone. Yeah. >> So, how can it go and read something a kilometer deep if it's absorbed in the exact same type of limestone at a depth of 15 m? >> I agree.
(1:51:12) >> Big problem. >> I understand. Yep. So, we need answers on this. That's my only point about this subject. >> Okay. >> So, they also >> Can you go back to that scan again? The colorful one? >> Of course, because this is going to come up again. The the the actual raw scan. >> So, what is the red supposed to be? >> Okay.
(1:51:32) So, the red is these possibly hidden structures that they are detecting above the Belleone chamber. So, this chamber over on the left is known as the Belleone chamber. This image is showing their raw scan data above the Belleone chamber. >> Okay. >> Showing these possible hidden features. >> So the red the red should be pockets. >> Basically they are saying that the red are chambers.
(1:51:59) >> Got it. >> That's what they're saying. >> Got it. >> Above the bleon chamber in the central pyramid. >> Directly above the Belleone chamber. >> Definitely interesting. >> Okay. So this goes back to the search for hidden chambers in the ben in the central pyramid where in the 1970s they scanned this same area above the bleone chamber using muon scanning technology.
(1:52:30) The same technology that they used to discover the big void above the grand gallery in the great pyramid. This is vetted scanning technology that we know works. >> Muon. >> Muon scanning technology. The scan pyramid team. >> Yes. >> That discovered the big void. >> Yes. >> They use muon scanning technology. >> Okay.
(1:52:53) >> The same muon technology was used in the central pyramid. The structure of the second pyramid of Giza is determined by cosmic ray absorption. This Muon technology uses cosmic rays to detect internal chambers. Whoa. >> And it's a vetted technology for imaging the inside of structures. >> Okay. >> They scanned the same area above the Belleone chamber and they found nothing.
(1:53:22) >> Okay. >> Using vetted Muon imaging technology. Would Muan be able to detect into the bedrock? I don't know about bedrock, but they do use it for the inside of pyramids to image these structures. I'm not sure about bedrock, >> but here in this instance, we're talking about the area above the Belleone chamber.
(1:53:48) So, here at the center, right, that's the Belleone chamber. >> Okay. >> The S team is saying that they've discovered evidence of chambers directly above the Belleone chamber. >> Okay. Well, in the 1970s, they used this Muan technology to scan the same area directly above the Belleone chamber and they didn't find anything. The quote here, we therefore conclude that no chambers of the size seen in the four large pyramids of the fourth dynasty are located in our field of view above the Belleone chamber. Okay.
(1:54:25) >> So, they scanned approximately 19% of the volume of the total pyramid located directly above the Belleone chamber. >> Got it. Got it. >> So, about 20% of the volume. >> Okay. >> In this exact same area where this S team is saying they are discovering evidence of hidden chambers. >> Okay.
(1:54:49) So there's a an issue here where the vetted scanning technology is not being corroborated by this team. So there's a there's a disconnect there between this vetted muon technology that we know for sure can detect internal chambers because it found the big void. >> They've corroborated the existence of the big void. So we have physical evidence that this big void exists. Mhm.
(1:55:14) >> This Muon technology didn't find anything above the Belleone chamber. >> So, there's a disconnect there. >> Did they Did these guys use their technology to scan the Great Pyramid? >> Yes. >> What did it look like? >> And I'll show you that in just a minute. So, this is their >> quit teasing me, Jeffrey. >> It's a process.
(1:55:32) And I promised you that I would go through this step by step. >> Yes. >> And show you all of the evidence that they have presented. >> Okay. so that you can make and the viewers can make an objective interpretation of this. >> Can I pee real quick? >> Absolutely. >> All right. Thank you. We'll be right back, folks. >> So, again, shout out to my lovely wife, Alexa.
(1:55:51) Her channel name is actually Archo Alchemy. She changed it from the previous name that I mentioned, Archo Alchemy. And she just stuck her head in here and said it was June >> cuz she knows the dates. The wives always know the dates. June 2025. Couple months ago. Yeah. >> Yeah. It was beautiful. Malta is spectacular. >> I bet.
(1:56:09) and we investigated the hypogeem and a number of ancient structures in Malta. Fascinating place. So this is them during the Malta conference presenting all of these new scans of the area above the Belleone chamber in the central pyramid. >> Okay, >> just showing the new scan data. But as I mentioned, I've been covering this since 2022 >> when they published their first scan and paper of the Great Pyramid.
(1:56:34) So my interest in this team's work goes back several years, way before the hype that's going on now about these new central pyramid scans. >> Okay. >> So this is their first paper. Synthetic aperture radar Doppler tomography detects undiscovered highresolution internal structures of the Great Pyramid of Giza. >> Interesting.
(1:56:56) >> So let me quote one thing here. >> Okay. One problem with synthetic aperture radar is that given the limited penetrating effect of the electromagnetic waves inside solids, the capability to image inside distributed targets is excluded. So this is basically saying existing S technology cannot penetrate solid objects.
(1:57:24) So it is unable to image inside of the respective target. This is a quote directly from their research paper. And again the whole point of the new stuff that they are doing is this beyond protocol. So under these circumstances again I'm quoting directly from the paper here. Under these circumstances, imaging activity is only given on the surface of a distributed target.
(1:57:55) This paper describes an imaging approach based on the investigation of micro movements on the kum kufu pyramid usually generated by background seismic waves. Okay. >> So, they're using this Beyond protocol and his proprietary software >> to what's inside >> to interpret micro vibrations on the surface of the structure.
(1:58:25) >> Okay. So, again, the radar signal cannot penetrate the object. >> Period. >> Yes. It is the new software >> that they are using this Beyond protocol that interprets these micro movements on the surface as indicative of internal chambers. >> Got it. I understand. >> Okay. So they say here again using the quote that it becomes transparent like a crystal.
(1:58:52) >> So when you make a claim like transparent like a crystal, I would expect to see something that is transparent like a crystal. Mhm. >> So now let's walk through their first paper. They make two statements here that the Great Pyramid of Giza is built from granite blocks. First in the introduction, second in the Giza plateau presentation and description, they say the pyramid of Kum Kufu is a monmental structure built mainly of granite blocks.
(1:59:22) >> Okay, that's that's the first mess up. >> That's not true, >> right? >> It's made of limestone, >> right? with the exception of the granite inside the king's chamber and anti-chamber. >> Right. >> That's the only granite in the whole pyramid. >> Inside the Great Pyramid. Correct. >> The Great Pyramid. >> So, we could chalk that up to maybe translation, >> right? >> Because these guys are Italian.
(1:59:44) >> Maybe they use the wrong >> This was translated into English. >> But this is an academically published paper, >> right? If you're going to present this revolutionary new technology, it's super important to have the technical details correct >> when it comes to the configuration of the known structure. >> It's not made of granite.
(2:00:05) It's made of mostly limestone. >> Okay. So, here's their first images of their scans of the Great Pyramid. Here on the right is the raw scan. >> This screenshot is from their paper, >> directly from their paper. All of this comes directly from their published material. >> Like they overlaid that on that. Wow. >> Correct.
(2:00:30) On the left is a diagram of the Great Pyramid. >> You got to give it to them. They're at least not trying to fake it and make it look better than it really is. Like >> Sure. But if you look here, look on the raw scan data on the right. >> Yeah. >> Where is the King's Chamber looking at? >> No, there's nothing. >> Where is the Grand Gallery? Where is the subterranean chamber? >> There's there's the only thing that I can see that matches up with the pyramid on the left is the right side edge of the exterior of the pyramid.
(2:01:03) >> Yeah, kind of like where it meets the >> If you look at the overlay on the left, you can see the signature goes outside of the structure and into the air. >> That's what I'm saying. >> Yeah. the background, >> right? So like on the right you see the the the dark blue which would be like the air and then it changes.
(2:01:23) That's the pyramid, the outer surface of the >> edge of the pyramid. And you can see that on the diagram on the left >> where the differentiation between the blue and the red shows the slope angle of the outside of the pyramid >> which is limestone >> which is limestone. But if you look at the core, you see here on the left, there is a highlighted area around the queen's chamber on the left on the diagram.
(2:01:51) >> There's a little area of image. >> Yeah. >> Showing the signature of the queen's chamber. >> Totally. >> But there's nothing around the king's chamber. And there's nothing around the Grand Gallery or the subterranean. >> Well, couldn't one be the king's chamber number one up there? the kind of like little that little blob.
(2:02:11) >> It's possible and I think that's what they're showing on the diagram on the right that one is the king's chamber, two is the queen's chamber, and three is the descending passage and subterranean chambers. >> Yeah, you can see a little bit of a diagonal shape going down right through the number three block.
(2:02:32) >> Yep, >> that could be one of the descending chambers. Okay. >> But what's that the bright red thing right on the corner of it, though? >> It's background signal. >> Okay. >> So, that's another big issue >> is that there's tons of background signal in this imaging process. >> You know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of one of those magic eye images.
(2:02:52) The more you stare at it, the more you see the pyramid. >> I will say that it too on the right, we have a relatively clear signature of something that could be the queen's chamber. The queen's chamber. Yeah. >> So that's good. >> That's good. >> That's good. >> Okay. So So do this now. >> Yeah. >> Now show me what the scan pyramid scan looks like compared to this stuff.
(2:03:18) >> So that's another issue. They haven't published that. >> So the scan isn't that so the scan the scan pyramids team >> has never formally published their raw scan data. Why? As far as I know, I haven't seen it anywhere. I see a lot of diagrams and pictures of it, but I haven't seen any raw scan data >> and and that's also done with satellites.
(2:03:47) >> It's done with muon imaging technology. >> Is that part of satellites? >> No, no, no. It's done from internal. So, basically they have these >> airplanes. No, it's done from equipment located inside the structure that measures the absorption of cosmic rays that filter through the structure. >> Oh, >> so they have these muon detectors.
(2:04:09) These muons are these cosmic rays >> and the detectors inside of the structure. See, this is the >> Yeah. Okay. So, that's the raw scan right there. maybe showing the area behind the blocking stone. >> Okay, >> I saw something somewhere about drones or planes >> flying over the pyramids doing something. >> I don't know about that, but I know that when they were doing the if you click that one at the center, the top one at the center. No, no, no.
(2:04:43) Here, uh, or even in the center. Yeah, the white one. So when they were scanning the big void, right, they have these muon detectors that detect these cosmic ray particles that go through the structure and the muon detector images using the differences in these cosmic rays. >> I would love to see their raw data and see what it looks like.
(2:05:06) I would again so again I'm I'm being very objective in my analysis of this data and you're 100% correct that the Muan scanning team has never as far as I know in all of my research I've never seen the raw data from the Muan scanning project either. >> So take that take that for what it's worth. >> Yeah. >> Okay.
(2:05:28) So let's move through their paper on the Great Pyramid. >> Okay. So here again we see the king's chamber at the top overlaid with their raw scan data. So the diagram is on the left overlaid in the middle and raw scan data on the right. >> Mhm. Not a perfect match. >> Yeah. Again there's lots of background stuff.
(2:05:52) There's lots of noise in the raw scan data and they admit that this is a problem. The configuration of the chamber is not readily visible. They have some vague detection of stuff in that area. >> Mhm. >> But it's also above. It's also below. It's on the left and the right. It's not a conclusive image. >> Let me ask you this.
(2:06:13) What is the queen's chamber? Does it have granite in it? >> The queen's chamber does not have any granite. >> And the king's chamber does. >> The king's chamber is completely made of red granite. >> Interesting. including the relieving chambers. >> Maybe that's why you can't see the king's chamber. Maybe it can't detect granite.
(2:06:30) That would be >> They have other ones where they do show the granite beams. >> Okay. >> So, let's go again step by step here. >> Sure. What's next? >> Down at the bottom, images of the queen's chamber. So, there is a a highlight of something. Yep. >> In that area. >> Yep. >> Okay. >> And you can see it going parallel through it.
(2:06:48) >> Correct. You can kind of see the shaft >> y >> going horizontal out of the queen's chamber. >> So, I think this is a good one. >> So, this is a this is a positive thing. >> Yes, >> that corroborates. Again, I'm a stickler for the known chambers. >> Your new technology has to be able to show us what we know is there, right? And this is a good one.
(2:07:10) The queen's chamber shows up. Okay, so this is another image showing their scan of the king's chamber. So the diagram overlaid on top of the raw scan data. >> So this is another scan. >> So yeah, they took a bunch of tomographic lines. So this takes a long time. >> Oh, >> so every time the satellite goes over the pyramid, they they image it again.
(2:07:34) So they took a ton of these slices >> in the process of imaging >> and these are showing different slices of those tomographic lines. >> Right? >> So this one it kind of does show the red granite beams the horizontal beams but it also if you look below the red granite beams in the relieving chamber it's also showing horizontal signatures where there are no beams.
(2:08:01) >> So a quick question. >> Yes. on the illustration, the black and white illustration of the gas chamber. Yes. >> It looks like a bunch of blocks stacked next to each other. >> Correct. >> I thought they were single blocks that were stacked on top of each other. >> So, >> I don't know where they got the diagrams that were used in this paper.
(2:08:21) >> Uhhuh. >> So, I don't know where the this again, this these are screenshots. Anybody can download this paper >> and I don't know where they got these images, but yes, the relieving chamber beams are single pieces. Correct. >> So I don't again they they might have just downloaded the wrong >> graphic. >> Got it.
(2:08:41) >> Um but there you you kind of see these horizontal features scan to the king's chamber. >> It doesn't match exactly. There's some horiz it's it's close. So that's that's something. So take that for what it's worth. >> Okay. >> Okay. Here we go into some of their models and another tomographic line of the internal chambers.
(2:09:08) So here on the right you can see the raw scan data of the scan of the area above the Bone Chamber. >> Okay. So do not show the known configuration. >> Okay.
(2:09:51) And this comes directly from Filipo. He said that they created these models as an artistic interpretation of what they see in the raw scan data. >> Okay. >> In my opinion, >> I don't see any any connection between >> Exactly. That's that's my point. I do not see any justification for the extrapolation from the raw data into the model.
(2:10:20) No, >> it does not make any sense. >> No. >> Did you ask him about this? >> Yeah. >> What did he say? >> He said again it's an artistic interpretation based >> What did he say when you said it doesn't match at all >> again? So I asked him over and over in the Malta conference. Yeah. >> Why don't these things match? his answer repeatedly and again the whole thing is on film of me asking these questions during the Malta conference and he told me to ask questions during the presentation he said interrupt me and ask questions so anytime something like
(2:10:54) this came up this is a part when I was actually looking at it I said hey Fippo why here on this scan on the bottom left is it picking up the queen's chamber but it can't pick up the grand gallery and the king's chamber his answer was repeatedly I don't know >> okay very polite, very honest, very genuine. Again, Filippo is a good dude.
(2:11:14) >> Mhm. >> And I really, really like these guys, >> but this is one of the reasons that they trust my interpretation is because >> this is my life. Knowing the configuration of the pyramids, okay? >> And if there is a new technology to show us inner chambers, >> I want to make sure that it can first and foremost accurately detect what we know is there.
(2:11:38) That should be step one >> is proof of concept, which we'll get to that in just a second when they're talking about the modern structures that they scanned. >> So, here is the configuration of the chambers inside the Great Pyramid. And you can see that if you take a slice down the middle, you're going to get all of these chambers in the scan because they're all on top of each other.
(2:11:59) >> So, if you're slicing down the center of the queen's chamber, you're going to get the king's chamber. If you're slicing down the descending passage and the ascending passage into the queen's chamber and grand gallery, you're gonna get the king's chamber and the queen's chamber.
(2:12:17) So, it's very difficult to take slices down these things where you don't pick up the other chambers. >> Right? Again, if you took a tomographic line down the far left side of the king's chamber, >> you're going to only get an image of the king's chamber and not the rest of the queen's chamber >> because they're not all lined up. >> Correct.
(2:12:39) There are um areas of the structure where everything is aligned, but there are some very specific areas where only the king's chamber would come up in a scan. >> Interesting. So again, it's this idea of tomographic lines and slices of the structure where this is a good explanation >> for why. >> Yes. >> Now, this doesn't apply to the central pyramid because if you slice down the middle of the structure, everything in the central pyramid is aligned at the center of the central pyramid.
(2:13:08) >> Okay? >> So you you should be able to detect those structures. If you're imaging above the Belleone chamber, you should also be able to detect the internal structures. Interesting. >> So, this is an explanation for the tomographic line. >> Okay. >> Again, raw scan data overlaid on top of an image of the Great Pyramid.
(2:13:26) They're also showing here that they're detecting this newly discovered chamber or shaft on the northern side. >> That could be the big void. >> No. No. So, the big void is located directly above the Grand Gallery, >> which they're not really showing this big void either, which is said to be the same size, length, and shape of the Grand Gallery.
(2:13:49) That's not showing up either. >> Okay, >> again, good point. We don't have the raw scan data from the scan pyramids team and their Muon data showing us the exact configuration either. >> So, again, take it for what it's worth. This is just an objective analysis of what we have. So you see here on the right in tag 17 and 18 that area of detection in the raw scan, it kind of overlays with this newly discovered shaft that they found on the northern face below the chevrons.
(2:14:23) So here again, the image above the Grand Gallery doesn't show us a big void in the same area that's reported by the scan pyramids team, but we don't have that raw data to compare it either. >> Right? >> So this is kind of a not situation where it's neither neither one or the other. We can't corroborate or validate the scan of the area above the Grand Gallery cuz we don't have the Muon data either.
(2:14:54) >> So, we can't say if their imaging technique is good compared to the vetted technology. >> Okay. So, here are some more scans showing tag 1, 4, and 7 that are shown here on the model. These inclined features that they're detecting inside of the Great Pyramid that they have modeled here on the left.
(2:15:16) So they are picking up something these long diagonal features that they show here in white and black. Seven is a transverse beam >> and one and four are these step-like features and four is going down into the bedrock. So is there something in the raw scan data? Possibly. Do I think it's justified to show it in the model like what they have there? I don't see it.
(2:15:47) >> Yeah. Got it. >> So, this is just a comparison between the raw scan data on the right. Again, this is all coming directly from their paper tag number two, which is shown in the model at tag number two, which is the same thing as number one, but on the other side, >> right? >> This step-like feature.
(2:16:08) I don't see any steps. >> No. >> In the raw scans. >> No, I don't. I don't see where they're getting this step-like feature in the model. >> It kind of looks like a step there. Number two. >> Yeah, maybe a little bit. I don't know. >> I'm not sure again. >> But where is two on the left? I don't see two on the left. >> It's the other.
(2:16:28) So the white step feature at number one on the model. Look at the other side. That's number two. >> Ah, I see. >> Yeah. So it's one and two on each side. >> Yeah. I don't know how you come up with that model from that. >> Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch. >> It is a bit of a stretch. So again, take it for what it's worth.
(2:16:44) More scan data and more models. >> Yeah, >> this is all coming directly from their first paper. Raw scan data on the right, their artistic model on the left. >> Okay, so here is again more raw scan data. They're saying tag number 10 is the uh the zed here and tag number 10. They're saying tag number 10 is the grand gallery and the zed with the arrow is supposed to be the king's chamber.
(2:17:12) >> The zed? What are you talking? >> They call the king's chamber the zed chamber >> for some reason. I don't know why they've picked that nomenclature thing, >> but anytime you see zed, they are referring to the king's chamber. >> Okay. >> Okay. Okay. More raw scans compared to the models.
(2:17:32) Raw scan data compared to the model. >> All right. >> Are they detecting something? Again, you see zed here, which is supposed to be the king's chamber. Um, compared to the model that they're showing. >> All right. >> Tag number 19 that you see here in the model in green is reflected in the raw scan data on the right. They're saying this is the big void >> at tag number 19.
(2:17:55) >> Okay. But it's so difficult to differentiate between the background signal that >> we really have no idea what they're looking at. No. >> Nor do we have any corroboration from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities that this was even a scan of the Great Pyramid. We have no idea what it is. >> Because technically speaking, they did this illegally without the approval or collaboration of the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities.
(2:18:19) They just used the satellites. They shot radar beams at the pyramids. >> Yeah, but that's not illegal. It is illegal to shoot something from space, take a picture from space. >> From the perspective of the Egyptians, it's absolutely illegal from a moral international law. Nobody owns space. >> Right. >> Right. So, is it >> a crime? The Egyptians would say yes.
(2:18:41) Again, take it for what it's worth. >> Yeah. >> But they had no permission from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities to scan any of this stuff. >> Sure. So we don't know for sure that this is even an image of the pyramid because we have no archaeological or academic collaboration between this completely independent team and academic or government sponsored >> institutions.
(2:19:06) Is there any reason to believe that uh the Egyptians are pissed off that they did this? >> Oh they are. I know they are for sure. Yeah. They loathe this team. >> How do you know that? >> I know people in E. Dude, I live in Egypt. I have friends that are members of the Ministry of Antiquities Administration team. They hate these guys.
(2:19:25) >> Why? >> Because again, they circumvented the powers at be. You can't do this when it comes to Egyptian archaeology. I'm not saying that's the right thing. And I do think the public, >> they're pearl clutching >> should have this type of technology for scanning and doing this type of thing. So, what they're trying to do is very, very important.
(2:19:47) But from an academic and archaeological perspective, you have to work with the team >> to be taken seriously. >> Yeah. >> Which is why this S team is having a lot of trouble getting traction in the conventional scientific and academic community. >> Right. >> Because they circumvented all of that and they are completely independent, unsponsored, unapproved team, >> which is okay.
(2:20:12) >> Yeah. >> I'm not saying that that's a negative thing. I'm just explaining that that the Egyptians are going to work with them now because they they're pissed off. >> Never. Again, we we talked about at dinner that they will never be granted permission to move a grain of sand in Egypt. >> They've burned all of the bridges.
(2:20:28) >> Wow. >> So again, more raw scan data. >> Yeah. >> More models. Okay. From their first paper. >> All right. What about the [ __ ] underneath? >> Driven that home. Okay. So here, right, they're scanning the Great Pyramid. There's nothing underneath the structure. Well, you can't really see underneath, right? >> Well, they have it on the right where they're scanning down >> into supposed to show underneath, too.
(2:20:50) >> Correct. >> Okay, I see. >> So, there's no in their first paper, they're not showing any structures below the Great Pyramid. >> Nothing. >> Mm- >> Okay, that's important. >> Yes, >> because now they're saying that there is. >> So, why does it not come up on this original scan? You kind of have that little thing on the left that kind of goes down below, but >> but it starts in the air.
(2:21:16) >> It starts in the air. >> It starts in the air. It goes through the side. So, we have It's most likely background interference. >> So, this whole thing could just be background signature where some of it just happens to land on top of the known chambers. >> A gaba ghoul. >> Yeah. >> Okay. >> So, we have no idea what this is.
(2:21:35) >> All right. >> Filippo Beyond is the only guy that knows this proprietary technology. So this is just my objective assessment. Again, here you see the scans not showing anything below the structure. And more models. These are more models that they created to show what they think is hidden inside the Great Pyramid.
(2:21:58) >> No mention whatsoever of subterranean features. So now this is their official abstract of the conference and their formal press release for the new scans that happened for the central pyramid. Okay, again these are the models from their first pyramid scan and this is their new data, the raw scan data of scanning above the Belleone chamber.
(2:22:26) Okay, so we have these images here. You see the one down at the bottom? They're saying that these down at the bottom are similar to their scans of the king's chamber. These sort of horizontal features. >> Yeah. >> So, they're interpreting this raw data as being evidence of chambers that look like the king's chamber in the central pyramid.
(2:22:49) >> Okay. Inside of it. >> Inside the central pyramid. Okay. Above the Bone Chamber. Okay. >> So, that's what this is, the raw scan data. high def image of that raw scan. >> Okay. Again, big problem with this. >> Look at the definition. >> Yeah. Um, again, they use the words quote transparent like a crystal. >> Yeah.
(2:23:12) >> I have a lot of problem with that verbiage. >> Yeah. >> So, they do have these vertical features here, uh, vertical and horizontal features that kind of look like their scans of the king's chamber. Mhm. >> So they're saying that this raw scan at the top is showing king's chamberl like features.
(2:23:38) So this is being extrapolated into this. Okay. So let's go back again. Raw scan data here of the area above the bell zone chamber. >> Okay. So does not show the known configuration. >> Okay. So what they're saying what this is what they're interpreting this image to be which is the middle pyramid is a bunch of king king's chambers >> correct >> inside of the middle pyramid >> correct >> and a bunch of cylinders going down into the into the earth >> right but in this raw data where are the cylinders >> I guess they're saying that those spikes
(2:24:14) that are going down >> doesn't look like it to me >> go to this go to the picture >> okay so now let's go to their model they're going from this >> what >> to extra ones. >> So, they're saying that there's a group of these king's chamberl like features that they're seeing in this and this.
(2:24:39) Again, this is the raw data >> and we don't know of any king's chambers in the middle pyramid. >> There's there's nothing in there. >> There's nothing there's nothing >> for you know that for a fact. >> This was done in the 1970s using this muon technology. They scanned this exact same area. >> Yeah. >> They didn't find anything. >> Okay.
(2:24:58) >> Now, is that true or not? >> I don't know. >> Okay. >> Same thing with the modern scans, the Muan scans. Where's the raw data? >> We don't have it. >> So, I'm not trying to debunk this. >> Mhm. >> You asked for my honest interpretation on this as a dedicated pyramid researcher, and I just got to call it like I see it.
(2:25:18) >> And what has your conversation been like? Like, it looks so much different. Like, right. I I see what you're saying. Like this seems like it seems bogus that they came up with that image, >> right? >> So when you present it in this way to Filippo or to Jay, Yeah. what do they say? >> Um they agree with all of my criticism.
(2:25:36) >> Okay. >> And they accept it as issues. >> So anytime I asked Fippo a question about why X Y and Z Yeah. >> he would say I don't know. I don't have an answer for that, but it's a really good question and we're working on it. >> Okay. So again, if anything, this is encouragement for the team to help them solidify their presentation and to corroborate some of this data.
(2:26:01) >> And didn't they say in the very first paper that they can't go into the ground s radar cannot penetrate the target object. These >> No, no, no. They said that when they scanned the middle pyramid, even with the Doppler tomography, they couldn't get into the bedrock. Right. So that was their explanation for why they can't detect the known chambers is because the radar signal is absorbed by the bedrock.
(2:26:28) >> So if that was their explanation for that, how do you square it with this? >> Exactly. That's my whole point of contention. It does show something, but these are also modern machines, right? That are actively producing vibrations. Yeah, >> that's what their software is designed to detect.
(2:37:30) Micro vibrations inside of a structure that are read on the surface >> to show what's inside. >> Sure. So, it's going to be more pronounced for something that's active in use. >> Again, Gddard Tunnel, another tunnel that they scan that's inside of a mountain. This doesn't look anything like the other raw scan data. >> So whatever they're using to produce this image and these proof of concepts in my opinion are excluded from the conversation because it's not the same type of technology.
(2:38:00) >> Yeah. And the also the things that people are seeing on Instagram and on Twitter and all that all over social media are they took his images and then they enhanced them even more on AI to make them look insane. >> It's all propaganda, dude. Yeah, >> it's all AI >> propaganda taken and it's been >> everybody's looking at these models.
(2:38:20) Look at the models. Look at the models of the things and these AI generated images. >> Me, I want to see the raw scan data. >> Show me on that raw data evidence of what you're talking about. >> Right. >> So, are these showing something? Yes. Does it look like the same raw scan data that we see with the pyramids? No.
(2:38:43) again. >> Well, his paper's out for peer review right now, right? So, >> the second one is coming out soon. I don't know if it's been formally published yet. Okay. But >> so the peer review process has to happen first before publication. >> Right. Exactly. >> So, it hasn't been officially published yet. Exactly. Right.
(2:38:59) >> It's out for peer review. >> It's for peer review. Yes. >> Correct. Yeah. Which I give a lot of credit to these guys. You know, this is pretty revolutionary stuff. And like I said at the beginning, this is not an attempt to debunk their work. All I'm doing is calling it like I see it.
(2:39:18) You can either love it or you can hate it. You can believe it. You can not believe it. I don't care about anyone's opinion. >> The only thing I can do is critically analyze this stuff and give my opinion, which is what you asked me to do today. Right. >> And I think after seeing all this stuff, >> again, hopefully I didn't rain all over your parade.
(2:39:36) >> No, no, you didn't. This has been uh >> this has been great. >> Pretty interesting, right? >> No, it is. It's very it's very rare that you find people that are going like all the way down to the source of this stuff to figure out what's actually happening. It's hard to do nowadays. >> So, again, he's talking about here in the pre uh presentation how the scanning is actually obtained.
(2:39:54) Again, it's flyovers of these radars that generate range compression. So, there you can see the first raw scan data. They then compress it, interpolate it and azimuth compression to create the target object all within the software. >> So it's a it's a complex process. I think the plane is meant to represent >> a satellite.
(2:40:16) >> A satellite. >> Got it. >> So this fourstep process done in the software is what generates the final pinpoint image of the object. >> Okay? So, it's a complex software algorithm that does all of this stuff. It even says down there, it's an illustration of the sequence of operations in this Doppler algorithm, >> right? >> It is the software that is unique to the Beyond protocol.
(2:40:44) >> He again saying this vibration analysis, it's not scanning the structure. It's picking up phonons on the surface. These micro vibrations that they're actually using to scan these things. So the Osiris shaft, they scan something that has a vague con similar configuration to the Osiris shaft. >> Mhm. >> So here you see the points on the raw scan data that they're saying are lining up with the Osiris shaft.
(2:41:11) >> Okay. >> It's very vague. >> Yeah. And shout out to Night Scarab who actually did the measurements and he found that the measurements of their scan does not add up to the actual configuration. >> Whoa. >> So the whole upper level is off by more than four meters. So there's people that have really done indepth analysis of this.
(2:41:35) >> Yeah. >> And something doesn't add up about the scan compared to the known configuration of the Osiris shaft. Yeah. >> Not to mention the water level, which is another big issue. >> Yeah. >> So, this is where they're scanning below the final pyramid, the men raw pyramid, showing these same vertical features.
(2:41:54) >> Wow. >> These tubes, cylinders, >> definitely something there. >> It it I again, I have my own personal interpretation of what's causing this, but I don't want to talk about it publicly because I'm not an S expert. I have an opinion about what's causing this, but until I get corroboration from Filippo and actually get to have a good sitdown conversation with him, I don't want to provide speculative interpretation for what's causing this.
(2:42:25) >> Sure, >> I'm not qualified to technically analyze what's happening in his software, but there's a lot of signatures in this thing that are not indicative of actual objects, >> right? M >> it's an artifact of the radar technology, >> right? >> Um >> so again they're scanning below the men ra pyramid.
(2:42:47) They're finding these vertical features here. You see one of them below the pyramid of men kara this vertical signature there on the right on the raw scan data. Again how do you get from that to this? >> I have no idea. Nor are they properly representing the water level. So, they're showing the water level super deep below the Giza Plateau, >> which is not true.
(2:43:13) >> Um, shout out Matt Simpson again, ancient architects did a full video on this. >> That's where the water should be. >> That's where the water level is. >> Wow. >> But they're showing it way down here. >> Interesting. >> Which is not accurate. >> So, there's a big problem there with their representation of the water table on the Giza Plateau.
(2:43:37) So some some pretty major issues, >> right? >> And this was the conclusion of the uh presentation showing the vertical columns below all the structures on the Giza plateau. We showed how in the Great Pyramid original scans there were no vertical features. Now they're saying that there are vertical features. Again, how can this be true if your radar signal is absorbed in 15 meters of bedrock? Man, >> yeah, >> that's the nail in the coffin for me.
(2:44:04) And it comes directly from them, >> right? >> We can't detect the known chambers below the central pyramid because our radar gets absorbed in 15 meters of bedrock. >> Well, hopefully we can get some answers soon. >> We'll see what happens. And I'm looking forward to reading their officially published paper. Yeah.
(2:44:21) >> And again, I've been following this for several years and I'm super interested in it. >> Is there some viability and potential for this technology? Yes, 100%. But there's also some unanswered questions that need to be addressed first before this can really be taken seriously from an academic perspective, >> which is why the community at large, from the scientific community >> has rejected this right off the bat >> because there's so many unanswered questions and issues regarding the known configuration. And this is again it's a
(2:44:59) completely novel technology. >> Not the radars themselves but the software used in the Beyond protocol which is kind of a big discussion now about this being vetted technology. The radars themselves are but the approach to image inside of structures using this SR is a novel proprietary process developed by Filipo Beyond.
(2:45:25) >> Right. Well, Jeffrey, >> dude, this was epic, man. >> We just did a six and a half hour [ __ ] marathon podcast. >> Yeah. So, feel free to, you know, chop it up and it's going out raw. We're raw dogging this thing straight straight to the world. They're going to get every single bit of it.
(2:45:41) We'll break We'll break it up into chapters. People can >> dissect it in chunks over weeks. >> Yeah, for sure. For sure. >> But dude, thanks again, man. This has been super enlightening, super fun. >> My pleasure. >> I learned a fuckload. >> Thank you. and uh >> it's a huge compliment to hear the feedback from from you and other podcast hosts that >> you know again it's the most comprehensive explanation that they've ever heard.
(2:46:04) Um so if anybody wants to come to Egypt, >> I'm hosting a tour in 2026 at the end of the year. Send me an email contact atthelandofm.com subject line 2026 Egypt tour. You can come on Egypt tour to see all this stuff up close in person including a detailed investigation of the iron veins on the Giza plateau. Mhm. >> Go subscribe to Let's Go with Lex and G, >> Egyptian Trash Cats, and my wife's channel, Archo Alchemy.
(2:46:30) Um, there's links in all of my YouTube videos. Um, I didn't mention my book, this entire podcast, which is good. Son of a [ __ ] >> So, last plug if you want to pick up a copy of the book. I do have a book available. >> Uh, landofke.com. Also have tons of merch. Yeah, shout out my beautiful wife Lex Arche from Archo Alchemy.
(2:46:47) So, she's got a video if you scroll up there on the 400 meter long tic tac object. So, if you want to see her analysis of the lost labyrinth, um, we've been >> Oh, we didn't talk about the Tik Tok. The Tik Tok. >> There's no such thing. I showed you the raw scan data at dinner last night. >> Yeah, >> there's nothing there, bro.
(2:47:04) >> We looked at the raw scans of the labyrinth and there's nothing that shows a metal tic tac. >> There's nothing there. >> Who came up with that? Who said there was a metal tic tac? >> I don't want to point fingers. >> Come on. Who was it? >> I don't No. No. It's It's not appropriate.
(2:47:16) Hey, they they they said it and so we can say it. >> Yeah, they claim it. >> But there's a number of people in the community that are circulating the rhetoric of 40 m long. >> Who started it? That's my question. >> I don't know where it came from. Okay. All I know is certain people have picked up on it and ran with it. >> And it's this type of rhetoric that is detrimental to legitimate archaeological investigations.
(2:47:38) Same thing with the S team. By circumventing the powers at be, >> we probably will never get access to excavate any of this stuff. they'll shut it down completely. That's just how the Egyptian government works. Same thing with this Tik Tok UFO thing. By talking about rhetoric like that, it completely discredits any possibility for legitimate archaeological investigations.
(2:48:00) Because if you're associating your research with UFOs and XYZ, it's over from for a possibility of actually excavating in Egypt, >> right? >> You have to tow the party line. Whether that's right or not, I don't necessarily agree with it, but it is what it is in terms of how things operate in Egypt >> for now. >> For now, until the some of those old fossils die off and get replaced by young younger, more open-minded folks.
(2:48:25) Yeah. Who >> It's certainly possible. Yeah. >> And it also requires lots of money. >> Yeah. >> And nobody's pumping the the money that would be required for the excavation of the Hawara Labyrinth. >> Hopefully Matt Bell can do it. >> We'll see. He's he's actively involved in these things in the Great Pyramid, the investigation of the Queen's Chamber, Northern Shaft, and the Great Void Exploration.
(2:48:47) They're going in there and they're going to see what's actually in there. >> I'm [ __ ] pumped, dude. >> So, shout out to Matt for stepping up. Shout out to Matt, >> you know. Um, again, I'm really excited to see what happens. 2026 is going to be a big year, man. >> I'm pumped >> across the board. >> Well, we got to do this again next year.
(2:49:01) Hopefully, if you come back and we'll do an update. >> I'm not coming back to the US for a while. Yeah. Yeah. 2027 will be the next time that we come back. >> All right. We'll make it happen. >> Yeah, but you can come to Egypt or Japan. >> I'm down. >> Yeah, >> definitely on my Definitely on my bucket list, dude.
(2:49:13) >> Danny Jones podcast, Egypt expedition. >> All right, bro. We'll link all your stuff below. All the links. People can find it right down below. >> That was massive, dude. >> Including all the papers. Dude, that was fun. >> Shout out Egyptian Trash Cats. Best channel on YouTube. >> Egyptian Trash Cats, baby.
(2:49:25) All right, we're out. Good night everybody.
