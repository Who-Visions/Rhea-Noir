(00:05) [Music] Okay. So, what you were just saying is, you know, the barrier of entry. >> Yeah. >> And how it can be very, very difficult for people to get engaged in this hypothesis. Yes. Because it requires so much investment in understanding it. And that's why I preface what we've done thus far regarding the Egyptian pyramids with the foundation of supporting evidence that shows the evolution and development of the technology coming from point A in stone circles to Egyptian pyramids with all of the same knowledge applying to the function of
(00:39) all of the structures. And of course we can do short overviews of these things but the function of ancient technology should be a complex in-depth discussion and I take it as a great compliment that you know it takes a long time on these podcasts to get through all of the information and all the research. >> Mhm. Yeah. No, it does.
(01:01) Like yeah the barrier and entry thing is um the biggest thing for me which is like >> it's a double-edged sword. >> Sure. >> Right. because it might be harder for something like this to go viral on the internet or something like that or to make a really [ __ ] fascinating like clip about like oh my god this is crazy I got to share it you have to really [ __ ] dive in >> to everything and it's going to take hours to really understand it to make it click and to like then you zoom out and you're like holy [ __ ] this makes the
(01:31) most sense >> like this really does make the most sense >> and in my opinion I take that as a compliment it's how it should be >> this is not simple technology. >> This is not something that you're going to be able to download on a Tik Tok video. >> It's the evolution over thousands of years of deep understanding of the forces of nature, physics, and chemistry that resulted in the development of the most complex >> type one civilization technology that we see on the planet. Mhm.
(01:59) >> Their mastery of the forces and cycles of nature from the power source to the physics to the chemistry is something that's almost beyond our comprehension. >> Mhm. >> And like Steve was saying, he was like, you know, why don't you make that model out of steel. >> Instead of using plexiglass, use steel. That's exactly what Fritz Habber did is he took the engineering of the red pyramid and instead of using plexiglass or stone he used steel reaction chambers which led us to the development of the habber process and the modern
(02:33) manufacturing of ammonia that we have today >> is by using steel reaction chambers the same shape though right >> it was you know it's the same physics they're cylinders >> but you're still using >> the manipul of temperature and pressure and pressurized gas and electrical current to drive these chemical reactions.
(02:56) So that's exactly what he did is the same idea that Steve had is like instead of making a model out of stone or plexiglass, why don't we make it smaller out of steel? Mhm. And >> that's exactly what Fritz Haber did is build that small apparatus with the exact same configuration of the red pyramid which led to our modern industrial scale ammonia manufacturing.
(03:17) The exact same thing that we just saw. >> Right? >> So we're going to breeze through the bent pyramid. >> Okay. >> I'm just going to kind of comment on the process where they're using the carbon dioxide byproduct of the red pyramid and the aquous ammonia solution to produce ura. primary application being for fertilizer.
(03:38) I've also proposed an alternative hypothesis for the function of the bent pyramid for the production of nitric acid >> which again when you combine nitric acid with hydrochloric acid you can produce aqua regia the only well one of the only aquous chemicals that can dissolve gold. So it always goes back to gold and the processing of gold ore and the separation of pure gold.
(04:02) So here I'll run through the animations on the function of the bent pyramid just so you can see that the same mechanisms of operation apply to the function of the bent pyramid that also apply to the red pyramid. So we had the carbon dioxide byproduct that was being produced in the manufacturing sequence in the red pyramid that is introduced into the reaction chambers along with the aquous ammonia solution to produce ura with the satellite pyramid being a hydraulic press that controls the operation of the stone valves within the bent pyramid. So
(04:34) here we have the filling process filling the primary reactor with aquous ammonia introducing the carbon dioxide which produces a chemical reaction that generates either ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate depending on the temperature and pressure conditions. I won't get into the weeds on that right now.
(04:51) >> Okay. >> So we're filling it introducing the gas creating ammonium bicarbonate or ammonium carbonate. Next sequence is activating the pump shafts to introduce more water into the facility. The exact same mechanisms of operation that we just saw in the red pyramid where water from the reservoir was introduced into these pump shafts and the pump shafts were utilized to manipulate the water level within the chambers.
(05:20) So you have a solid compound that's developing inside the primary reaction chamber. The only way to redesolve that is by introducing more water into the reactor, which is where the water from the reservoir comes into play. The water from the reservoir is introduced into the lower chamber system. It will fill the northern pump shaft.
(05:42) That pump shaft is activated to press more water into the connecting passage. >> That water will then fill the western pump shaft. Then the western pump shaft is activated to pump more water into the primary reactor to dissolve the solid compound and the whole thing is extracted through the lower separation chamber system. >> Okay, >> so here's kind of an animation showing the function of the bent pyramid.
(06:02) If anyone wants to go more in depth on any of these topics, check out my YouTube channel. >> Perfect. >> Okay, the great pyramid. So, we talked about at the beginning of the episode how if we were to travel to an extraterrestrial planet, >> yes, >> the moon, the Mars, or an asteroid. >> Uhhuh. >> The first >> Atlas, >> the first thing that we would do is build in situ chemical manufacturing and mining facilities.
(06:32) This is a paper talking about the proposed silicut sulfuric acid process mineral processing for insitu resource utilization. That's been the whole topic of this overall podcast is utilizing insitue natural resources for producing chemicals for metallurgical applications. >> Insichu mean >> on site. >> Okay. So this is a paper.
(06:57) The abstract is volatile elements and compounds found in extraterrestrial environments are often the target of insitu resource utilization studies. Um and long story short, this is saying that we would want to build a facility on an extraterrestrial planet that could exploit sulfur resources >> for the extraction of iron metal and the production of metals >> on site.
(07:25) This is exactly what the Great Pyramid was designed to do. >> This was from what you Okay. Uh Curtain University, >> correct? Yeah. The Space Science and Technology Center. So, this is just kind of entertaining the idea >> that again I don't buy into this that the Great Pyramid or any of the pyramids or any of this ancient structures around the world were built by extraterrestrials. Mhm.
(07:47) >> But if we were traveling to an extraterrestrial planet, >> we're already hypothesizing how we would extract minerals and create >> correct manufacturic acid manufacturing facility that utilizes extraterrestrial sulfur sources for these metallurgical processes. And this is almost verbatim exactly what was happening inside of the Great Pyramid where the Great Pyramid is built on top of a local source of sulfur for creating sulfuric acid for mining and metallurgical processes.
(08:24) >> See, that's all you had to do to sell it. Just a little dab, just a little cherry, >> little dab, a little alien cherry on top. Yeah. So, again, I don't I don't buy into that, >> right? I think that these were built by human beings, but I think it's fun to entertain these alternative hypotheses because again, there's a lot of rhetoric and mythology about extraterrestrials coming to the planet for mining gold.
(08:46) Specifically with the Anunnaki topic, again, I don't really buy into that. I think these are made by humans. But >> if humans were going to other planets, you don't build bring the stuff, you build it on site. >> That's exactly what we would do. creating sulfuric acid for metallurgy and mining applications.
(09:06) Okay, so let's dive into the function of the great pyramid. We're going to walk through the function of each chamber individually and I'll also discuss what is really below the Giza plateau. A natural cave and tunnel system and hydrothermal vents that created these iron oxide deposits and the source of the hydrogen sulfide that was utilized within the Great Pyramid to produce sulfuric acid.
(09:32) Mhm. >> Okay. So why would you create sulfuric acid? Mostly for metallurgical processes, >> right? So you can also make fertilizers, petroleum refining, metal processing. All of these applications that we've talked about across the board apply to sulfuric acid as a product of the Great Pyramid.
(09:56) Again, the product is not electricity. The product is chemicals. sulfuric acid specifically inside the Great Pyramid that can be utilized for processes like leech mining and the separation of metals. So this is a diagram from a paper that I'm about to present showing the natural cave and tunnel system below the Giza plateau below the Giza pyramids that also includes you see these big vertical features.
(10:25) >> Yeah. These hydrothermal vents that are from the ancient Tethus seafloor, hydrothermal vents can extend into the bedrock for kilometers. They are extremely deep vertical features that are a natural part of the limestone bedrock of the Giza plateau that are a part of this ancient seafloor. These hydrothermal processes are what created the iron veins on the Giza plateau.
(10:53) These deposits of iron metal were created by hydrothermal vents on the ancient Tethus seafloor that created the limestone bedrock of the Giza Plateau. >> Whoa. Okay. Sulfur directly under the pyramids. >> Directly below the pyramids. And I'm going to show you a paper that corroborates that talking about hydrothermal vent systems.
(11:16) >> Did you show this to your boy? >> Who? >> The Filipo guy. >> Oh, no. So they don't they I don't know that they know about this yet >> because this is a fairly recent discovery for me. >> I found this paper probably within the past 6 months. >> My original hypothesis for the s source of the sulfur is basically what we're talking about here is sulfur mining in Egypt.
(11:40) They were mining sulfur in ancient Egypt. That's a well doumented process. And they were using the sulfur for a variety of applications from cosmetics to pharmaceuticals. and they know where they were mining these things. For example, Gel Elzite, as I mentioned before, is one of the mining locations. Um, no, that's Wad and Eleras, which is kind of close to here.
(11:59) But they had specific mining areas uh close to the um Suez Canal that were the mining locations for native sulfur, like elemental sulfur. It wasn't until much later that I found this paper that supported the idea that there were actually sulfide deposits directly below the Giza pyramids. sulfide deposits. >> Yeah, specifically hydrogen sulfide gas.
(12:20) Now, they could have been extracting this sulfur using a process that is reminiscent of our modern-day fresh process, which is again pumping hot water into these sulfide deposits. Very similar to the process that was utilized in the step pyramid for the extraction of bedrock methane. >> Okay.
(12:43) So raw materials, we have talked about the Egyptian pyramids harnessing raw materials and utilizing those raw materials that are abundant resources of the earth for a variety of different manufacturing processes. So we have sulfur, air, water and methane. Again, step pyramid extracting bedrock deposits of methane.
(13:06) The sarapium converting air into hydrogen and oxygen. The red pyramid converting hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia and the great pyramid transforming sulfur and air into sulfur triioxide and dilute sulfuric acid. Okay, so the configuration of the king's chamber. There is a shaft system below the king's chamber.
(13:30) Shout out Matt Simpson from Ancient Architects recently did a video about this showing the shaft system below the king's chamber. That is the inlet for the hydrogen sulfide gas that was being introduced into the reactor. Same thing as we had here in the bottom of the final reaction chamber of the red pyramid, the final synthesis chamber, there was a shaft.
(13:52) That's why they excavated out all the stone from inside of the final synthesis chamber of the red pyramid. They were following that shaft. >> And what went in that shaft shaft? >> It's the extraction of the product. The aqua ammonia was being extracted out of that shaft system. I see. >> So there is a hole, a shaft in the bottom of the chamber telling me about this.
(14:12) >> Yeah. Yeah. They excavated down in this thing and they just found that it was filled with rubble and debris. So they abandoned the excavation. >> Mhm. >> This is the inlet shaft that was utilized to introduce the hydrogen sulfide, not hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide. The hydrogen sulfide is first converted into sulfur dioxide in a series of steps that happened in the satellite pyramids.
(14:34) Again, I'm going to breeze through this very quickly. >> Where's the Where's the inlet shaft here? >> So, let me show you. >> This is the king chamber looking at right here. >> Okay. So, here is a picture you see on the right where those blocks are. >> Yeah. >> Those are blocks that have been removed from the floor. >> Okay. >> And I'll show you the configuration.
(14:50) >> So, this is a modern picture that I took during one of my recent private special permissions into the Great Pyramid. The shaft, the shaft is now covered up with a modern metal grate, so you can't see the shaft anymore. And those blocks that were originally in there have been removed. >> Those red granite slabs that were a part of the floor are no longer in the structure. Okay.
(15:11) And they've covered it up with >> on the right there. >> Correct. Yeah. You see that metal gray? That flat piece of metal? >> Yes. >> Yeah. They've painted it to make it look like red granite, but that's where the shaft is going down into the bottom of the king's chamber. >> Okay. >> Here you can see it on this diagram. You see that shaft next to the container? >> That's the shaft that they excavated.
(15:28) >> No. Where? So you see the sarcophagus, the container. >> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That whole Yeah. So that's the inlet shaft that was used. >> Something came in there. >> Correct. The inlet shaft that was introducing sulfur dioxide >> into the king's chamber. So the hydrogen sulfide itself comes from below the Giza plateau.
(15:49) >> Hydrogen sulfide is what's naturally under the Giza. >> Correct. Okay, >> the hydrogen sulfide is converted into sulfur dioxide in a three-step series within the satellite pyramids. >> Okay, >> that sulfur dioxide is then introduced into the furnace chamber, the king's chamber through this inlet shaft. >> Where's the other end of that inlet shaft? >> What do you mean? >> Where's it? >> Comes from below the structure underneath the structure.
(16:14) >> It comes from in the ground >> connecting the satellite pyramids into the king's chamber. No way. We know this. >> So again, they excavated down into this hole that you can see there. >> Yeah, >> the hole was already there during the modern archaeological excavations. >> The hole was already there. They excavated further following the hole and all they found was that it was filled in with sand and debris.
(16:45) >> Okay, >> so they abandoned it. Okay, >> so that inlet shaft was already clogged with material. >> Okay, >> from thousands of years of material building up inside of the structure. Same thing as the king's chamber air shafts were clogged with material and they had to clear out that material from inside of the air shafts to remove all of that.
(17:09) And that's when air started flowing into the king's chamber air shafts. So this is just a picture looking down into this hole that you can see here on the diagram. And those speckled blocks are the pieces of the floor that were removed during the excavation to follow that hole. You can see those pieces would have fit here and here.
(17:31) And that red square is the original hole in the floor, the inlet shaft that was used to introduce the sulfur dioxide into the king's chamber. So, did they break up the pieces of rock and and remove them? >> Nobody knows what happened to it, >> but they're no longer in there. >> And how do we know for sure that that hole connects to the other pyramids? >> It we don't know for sure.
(17:51) >> Okay. This is just a hypothesis. >> Hypothesis, correct? Got it. >> Yeah. So, when it comes to my hypotheses on the various Egyptian pyramids, I try to do as little speculation as possible >> for things like the extraction shaft of the Red Pyramid. There has to be a reason that they excavated the entire floor of the final synthesis chamber and removed all of that material.
(18:19) There's a giant pit in there now. >> So, we don't know what the original configuration of this final synthesis chamber was. >> So, in my opinion, they were following the extraction shaft >> and they excavated all that material in search of the feronic burial and treasure, >> right? But all they found again was a pit that was filled in with material.
(18:41) >> Got it. >> So it was abandoned. >> I see. >> This is again my hypothesis about this shaft below the king's chamber which went down further but it was filled with material already.
