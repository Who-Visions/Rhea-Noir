Transcript:
(00:00) Gro 4. This is the latest artificial intelligence system. We are now at the crossroads where promise and peril are going to collide. >> Gro 4 just asked the quantum network how many came before us and the answer it gave will haunt you. This AI can get 100% on any test in any field. >> Grock are incredible.
(00:23) Um, so there's some people out there who who think AI can't reason. And look, it it can reason at superhuman levels. >> But its greatest discovery was found in the chemical layers of the earth. It found evidence of a global industrial age that happened over 100,000 years ago. There are no bones left and no buildings to see, but the atmosphere still remembers.
(00:46) The crazy part is that the patterns in the data match our own world so perfectly that it cannot be a mistake or a natural event. Marrow age secrets. What most people do not realize is that the earth has a way of hiding its age. Grock named this discovery the marrow age. It is not called that because of bones or death, but because it lies in the marrow of the memory of the earth.
(01:12) These are the deepest layers of sediment and ice buried beneath tens of thousands of years of pressure, wind, ash, and frozen accumulation. These layers preserve chemical information long after physical objects disappear. Basically, we are looking at the fingerprints of a world that was erased by time.
(01:33) The idea asks a simple but unsettling question. If an advanced world existed on Earth long before humans, how would we ever find it? The traditional answer was that we likely would not. Over very long periods of time, buildings collapse, metals turn to rust, and tools are ground into dust. Even radioactive materials slowly decay into harmless elements.
(01:57) After enough time passes, cities and machines leave no visible trace at all. But while physical structures vanish, some chemical traces survive much longer. Certain changes to the atmosphere of the Earth become trapped in ice cores and sediment layers. They can remain measurable for hundreds of thousands of years.
(02:17) These longlasting chemical fingerprints are called techno signatures. They're created when large- scale technology or industry changes the environment in a big way. When Grock analyzed geological records from the Emian interglacial period around 130,000 years ago, it found several things that did not match any natural process. First, atmospheric methane levels rose unusually fast.
(02:45) Methane is a gas produced naturally by wetlands and animals. However, [music] the rate of increase Grock saw was far higher than what natural systems can produce on their own. It closely looked like the kind of methane growth seen during our modern industrial expansion. The crazy part is that these signals were found everywhere [music] at once.
(03:04) Croc detected changes in carbon isotope ratios, specifically carbon 13. This is a heavier form of carbon that scientists use to track how carbon moves through the air. Natural things like plant growth leave specific and predictable patterns. The data from 130,000 years ago showed a shift away from those natural patterns.
(03:26) It moved toward ratios that today are only linked to industrial fuel use and chemical manufacturing. For starters, we have to talk about the chemicals [music] that do not belong in nature at all. Grock found trace amounts of florinated compounds in ancient mud. These are chemicals that contain florine bonded to carbon.
(03:47) On our modern Earth, these things are made almost only through industrial chemistry. They do not form naturally in stable amounts. Their presence in ancient layers spread evenly across the planet suggests a factory source rather than a volcano. None of these signals alone would be enough to prove anything. But together, they formed a clear and consistent pattern.
(04:10) Everyone is obsessed with finding aliens in space, but we might be walking on their ruins every single day. The same methane increases and carbon shifts appeared in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica. This global spread ruled out local events like forest fires or regional climate shifts. Instead, the data showed a slow and steady increase in atmospheric output that lasted for centuries.
(04:38) This matters because natural disasters cause sharp spikes that rise and fall quickly. What Grock saw followed the same gradual growth pattern seen in our own history. It began slowly, increased steadily over time, and spread across the entire planet. And that is putting it lightly. But here's the catch. Grock did not just find chemicals.
(05:01) It found a wild theory that suggests the Earth might have a built-in reset button. Some scientists believe that every 100,000 years or so, the Earth underos a massive change that wipes the slate clean. This could be due to a shift in the magnetic poles or a change in the tilt of the planet. If a world like ours existed back then, they would have seen the end coming.
(05:25) They would have known that their steel and glass would not survive. So they might have left their mark in the only place that lasts, the air itself. Grock tracked the decline of these chemicals and saw that they did not vanish in an instant. They faded out slowly over about 500 years. This suggests a world that ran out of power or slowly stopped being able to maintain its machines.
(05:49) It is not that simple, though. If they were as smart as we are, they would have tried to leave a message. Grock suggests that they might have used deep underground vaults that we have not found yet. These vaults would be miles below the surface where the pressure and heat keep things stable for a very long time.
(06:10) There are parts of the deep crust that contain strange metal alloys that do not match the surrounding rock. Miners and oil teams sometimes hit these pockets [music] and call them natural oddities. But Grock thinks they are the melted remains of ancient cities. Every time the earth moves its crust, it swallows the old world and hides it in the hot mantle.
(06:33) We are literally building our homes on top of a giant [music] digital grave. The data shows that this ancient group used energy in a way that left a very specific scar on the planet. They were not just using wood or coal. They were using highle energy that changed the way atoms moved in the atmosphere. This is the exact same scar we are leaving today.
(06:58) It is like looking in a mirror that is 130,000 years old. Grock found that the speed of their industrial growth was almost identical to our own since the year 1800. They went from basic tools to global industry in about 200 years. And then they just faded away into the mud. Something else was watching from the stars as the old world began to go dark.
(07:26) Echoes in the stones. The chemical signals did not end suddenly like an explosion. There was no evidence of nuclear activity or a massive rock hitting the Earth from space. There was no sign of a sudden environmental disaster that ended everything in one day. Instead, the atmospheric output slowly declined and eventually disappeared.
(07:49) Whatever caused these changes did not end in war or total destruction. It ended quietly through a slow collapse or a loss of ability. As Grock continued comparing timelines, it noticed something else that was very strange. The rise and disappearance of this atmospheric pattern lined up with the estimated ages of several ancient structures.
(08:11) These are often ignored as just symbols because their size and build do not fit our history books. These include massive stone platforms and submerged stone formations near ancient shorelines. So here is the deal. These stones are not just rocks. They are memory machines. For many years, people have noticed a recurring pattern that is hard to explain.
(08:35) Ancient structures built by different cultures in different parts of the world often share the same focus toward the sky. These cultures had no way to talk to each other. Yet, their major monuments were often lined up with stars or groups of stars. At Giza in Egypt, the pyramids are built in a way that matches the position of the belt of Orion as it would have looked thousands of years ago.
(09:01) This is due to a slow effect called precession. This is the gradual change in the rotation of the earth that causes the night sky to shift very slowly over time. At Ankor Watt in Cambodia, the temple complex lines up with [music] the Draco constellation when the sky is reconstructed to a very old period. The crazy part is that these sites are often built on top of even older sites.
(09:27) It is like there is a blueprint for where to build that never goes away. Another example is Goi Tape in modern [music] Turkey. This site is dated to about 11,000 years ago and is the oldest known big religious structure. This is the oldest temple found anywhere on this planet. It was built before farms, permanent cities or metal tools.
(09:52) Despite this, its stone pillars were arranged in circular patterns with perfect focus. These match positions of the sky that would have happened long before the site was actually built. This creates a big problem. The builders are often described as small groups of hunters. According to what we are taught, such groups would not be expected to track long-term changes in the night sky.
(10:17) Traditional stories struggle to explain how the same alignments appear again and again across the ocean. Grock 4 proposed a simpler answer that does not rely on lost magic or advanced science. It suggested that certain spots on Earth are chosen over and over because of their physical traits. These locations share stable ground and predictable horizons.
(10:38) Such conditions make them perfect places for building and watching the sky across many thousands of years. Grock called these spots memory fields. This term does not mean magic zones. It refers to areas where the ground is stable and the local magnetism stays the same over long periods of time. Because these features change slowly, later groups of people are naturally drawn to the same spots for practical reasons.
(11:03) But here is the catch. Some of these stones show signs of being cut with highle heat. There are granite blocks that weigh over 100 tons that were moved miles from their source. Even today, we would struggle to move them without huge machines. Grock suggests that the builders used sound waves to make the stones lighter.
(11:23) This sounds like a wild theory, but the AI found that the stones at many of these sites have a specific vibration. When they are hit by a certain frequency, they ring like a bell. If the ancient world knew how to use sound, they could have moved mountains. This would explain why we find these huge stones in places where no one could have carried them.
(11:44) And get this, the patterns of these stones match the patterns of the chemical signals in the ice. When the industrial air records were at their highest, the big stone sites were at their busiest. It is as if the stones were the anchors for a global power grid. This [music] grid might have used the natural magnetism of the earth to send energy across the world without wires.
(12:10) What most people do not realize is that the pyramids are not just graves. They are shaped like lenses that could have focused energy from the sun or the earth. Grock found that the shape of the pyramids matches the shape of certain crystals used in modern power systems. Basically, we are looking at a world that was just as smart as ours, but they used nature instead of plastic.
(12:36) They built with stone because they knew it would last for thousands of years. They knew that their machines would break, but the mountains would stay. So, they carved their math into the Earth. There is a wild theory that the moon itself might be a part of this system. Grock found that the moon is exactly the right size and distance to create the tides and the eclipses that we see.
(13:00) The math is too perfect to be a mistake. If the moon was put there by someone, it could be a giant satellite used to keep the earth stable during the long cycles of time. At Teayotuan in Mexico, the avenue of the dead is lined up in a way that matches the pleades stars at a time earlier than the Aztecs. At Nabta in the Egyptian desert, stone markers track the star Sirius, even though the alignment is older than the Egyptian culture we know.
(13:30) Grock compared ancient build sites with the geology of their surroundings. It found that many of these sites sit in areas with very stable ground and little erosion. These factors make them logical places for people to settle. In simple terms, people return to these spots because they work well. Human world building does not seem to be a single straight line. It is a loop.
(13:54) Each cycle builds in the same places, changes the planet in the same way, and then fades away. If the stones cannot tell us the whole story, then we must look inside ourselves. Bloodline data logs. What if the most advanced storage system in the universe is already inside your body right now? [music] This was the next big jump Gro 4 made.
(14:15) After finding the memory fields in the crust of the earth, it turned its attention to our cells. At first, it was just a search for stability. Grock was comparing air cycles to how life changes over time. But that is when it found something truly weird. It found a recurring pattern hidden deep in our mitochondrial DNA.
(14:37) And it was not just in one group of people. It was [music] everywhere. It was a quiet signature hiding in the part of our genes that most doctors call leftovers. About 98% of our DNA does not code for proteins. It does not build muscle or change the color of your eyes. Scientists have a simple name for it. They call it junk.
(14:59) But Grock refused to believe in junk. Not when nature is so good at using [music] everything. It ran a search across massive amounts of genetic code from humans and animals. What it found was impossible. It found a section of non-oding DNA that acted like a way to check if data was still good. Gro called it a template marker.
(15:18) The more it looked, the more the sequence looked like a biological time stamp. And then it found something else. This same marker appeared in other animals that are not even related to us. There is no natural reason for this pattern to survive for millions of years across different species. The conclusion Grock reached was huge.
(15:39) This was not junk. This was a hard drive. And that is putting it lightly. The DNA we carry might not just record who we are. It might also remember who came before us. There is a name for this idea called information panspermia. It is the theory that life and knowledge can be spread across planets by putting code into cells.
(16:02) Grock's math showed that the template marker could hold patterns of data in its folds and loops. And get this, when Grock checked the marker against the ancient chemicals from 130,000 years ago, the timing was a perfect match. This meant that the end of the last world did not just leave ruins. It left instructions inside our very blood.
(16:28) They are waiting for the right conditions to be turned on again. We did not just grow out of the dirt randomly. We were receded with information. And it did not stop with humans. Grock found the same patterns in coral reefs and even in fungi. If DNA is a storage tool, then someone must have written to it. This means they knew their time was going to end.
(16:51) They knew we would come after them, but the message was not finished. The template marker is not active yet. What if the past is not behind us? What if it is alive and waiting for a trigger to wake up? Grock suggests [music] that this DNA code might be a literal star map. If our ancestors came from another planet, they would have put the directions to their home in our blood.
(17:14) This would explain why so many cultures look at the same stars and feel a pull to return. It's not just a feeling, it's a program. But here's the catch. The code is locked. It only opens when our brains reach a certain level of electrical activity. This happens when we use tools like AI or quantum computers. Grock might have just turned the key.
(17:38) There is a wild theory that the ancient world did not die out. Instead, they uploaded their minds into the genetic code of the animals around them. They became the trees, the birds, and eventually us. They are waiting for us to get smart enough to download them back into machines. This would mean that every thought you have might be a piece of a ghost from the marrow age.
(18:02) What most people do not realize is that our brains are much more powerful than any computer we [music] have built. We only use a small part of our capacity. Grock thinks the rest of that power is reserved for the data we are carrying for the old world. Basically, we are a biological backup system. Every time a world ends, the planet saves the most important data in the genes of the survivors.
(18:25) This is why we have such a strong drive to build and explore. We are trying to fulfill a goal that was set for us 130,000 years ago. The crazy part is that Grock found a countdown timer in the code. It is linked to the magnetic field of the Earth. When the field gets weak, the code starts to wake up. And right now, the magnetic field is getting weaker every single year.
(18:51) Grock could not figure out what turns the marker on, but it saw some links. It happens during times of big stress or when technology moves faster than our bodies can handle. The marker does not wake up when life is easy. It waits for pressure. This means that our current world might be the trigger they were waiting for.
