Transcript Summary:
- The "Beyond Protocol": Developed by Filippo Bondi, Armando May, and Corrado Malanga. Interprets micro-vibrations (phonons/acoustic signatures) on the surface of structures using SAR + Doppler Tomography.
- The Detection Paradox: The SAR team admits they cannot detect known chambers (Belzoni's chamber in the central pyramid) because the 15m (45ft) of limestone bedrock purportedly "absorbs the signal."
- Critical Conflict: If 15m of limestone bedrock absorbs the signal, the claim that structures 1km to 2km deep in the *same* bedrock can be imaged is technically contradictory.
- Muon Scanning Discrepancy: Muon scans (validated technology using cosmic rays) from the 1970s scanned the 20% volume above Belzoni's chamber and found NOTHING, whereas the SAR team's "Raw Data" shows "Red Chambers" in that exact area.
- INTEGRITY NOTE: Filippo Bondi is noted for his honesty, admitting "I don't know" when confronted with these detection discrepancies.
- Key Takeaway: While the 4-satellite validation confirms identical raw data, the *interpretation* of that data as "man-made chambers" is under heavy scrutiny due to the lack of baseline calibration on known structures.
