(00:05) There are countless ancient mysteries still waiting to be unraveled all over our planet. Discoveries to be unlocked, secrets [music] to be revealed. Yet, undoubtedly, the jewel within the crown of these earthly ancient enigmas has to be that of the great pyramids of Egypt or indeed the entire Giza plateau. What is hiding within these gigantic, [music] perfectly constructed structures? What is laying beneath this long claimed man-made plateau? One once cast [music] in solid sandstone with its many yet to be explored caverns, cavities, [music]
(00:40) and even stairways, all once effortlessly cut through and into the underbelly of this enormous ancient [music] mass. Although countless scans of the plateau have been made with in-depth exploratory work done upon chops [music] in particular, the largest of the three pyramids and the only one so far [music] known to have existing inner chambers with these indeed producing some compelling results.
(01:05) What still lay deep within its bowels, one laced with hermetically sealed shafts, secret passages, [music] and enormous galleries, however, remains an impenetrable mystery. Yet could there lay within a mystery, perhaps even an entrance way into a secret chamber [music] which has long sat out in the open, one which those in the know, in particular a certain individual who has long been bestowed with the responsibility of running Egyptians ancient antiquities, and I have long claimed also responsible for upholding certain current paradigms. whom would
(01:39) rather, like that of whatever was found beyond the infamous Ganten Brick's door, prefer I not have stumbled upon. Well, one such enigma can indeed be found, hidden in plain sight, and it's just waiting [music] for someone not funded by particular academic circles to explore and to expose once and for all what's hidden within.
(02:03) Hiding within [music] the king's chamber, a chamber although claimed to be a mere 4,000 years old, proven within such places as the Grand [music] Gallery, with its slab work and megalithic placement, so precise, [music] constructed with such accuracy as to have once appeared finished like that of flat glass.
(02:24) However, within [music] and amongst these seemingly laser cut yet randomlysized 20 rectangular slabs, which made up the floor space of [music] the king's chamber itself, is revealed to have had two, in fact, long removed. Although Kufu's sarcophagus has been shown [music] to have been too small for his mummy, and with no mummies or any burial artifacts [music] ever found within the pyramid itself, these missing slabs within [music] this long claimed tomb have since been suspiciously and quietly covered in with cement.
(02:56) However, [music] the plot thickens once one realizes that within the original photography and indeed initial explorations of this mysterious room, the missing slabs are clearly apparent with the gaping holes within the chambers floor [music] clearly visible. These holes indicative of entranceways possibly into multiple hidden chambers.
(03:16) Yet, these would quickly be covered by wooden planks, later metal grates. Until rather recently, they were quietly cemented over. [music] clearly in an attempt to erase all evidence of this ancient out ofplace anomaly. What is hidden within the floor of the king's [music] chamber? What was originally within what has long been claimed as Kufu's [music] tomb? I feel that with recent developments beneath Kufu and indeed the clear lack of any evidence to not only suggest that these massive structures were once [music] tombs, but that they were even
(03:52) built by the ancient Egyptians a mere few thousand years ago. It would seem to me that the truth of what these structures once were. Along with the recent expose I shared of the enormous pyramid [music] which once sat proudly within Salt Lake City, one once constructed of solid copper blocks, the true [music] purpose and indeed possible function of these mysterious buildings, now identified [music] and located worldwide, could be far more profound and one I feel we get ever [music] closer to discovering with each
(04:24) passing day. What is beneath the king's chamber? What were the great pyramids used for? It is a [music] mystery which I continue to find highly compelling. >> We have measured approximately over 1 kilome of depth. >> Over a kilometer of depth. >> Do you think that the pyramid was a nuclear fusion machine? >> Please give me another another question.
(04:52) I don't know. Maybe the water goes through the these spirals and the spirals are made by PZO electric material. >> You think we can turn the power grid back on? >> But we do like that. >> There is a theory, perhaps even a lore which has long existed here upon the internet. For it is said that if one doesn't know something and has run out of places to look, instead of spending hours on the telephone talking to support lines, or spending thousands on a course, simply search out that anonymous prophetic hero who knew this
(05:32) day would come to pass, having posted everything one wished to know [music] within a small and succinct thread several years before upon Reddit. And as such before we began I would like to bring to your attention the following post created some 8 years ago under the account name of Braamus. Quote is it mere chance that the four elements of classical philosophy were always represented as triangles? I think not.
(06:05) The pyramid was a device used for harnessing the fifth element. It's definitely atomic, which is why we find mercury beneath pyramids across the world. It's used to diminish the effects of radioactive waste [music] as we do today. The element of fire is equivalent to the nuclear reaction with the pyramid also functioning as the element wind, an acoustic resonance chamber that was designed to push vibrations upwards.
(06:30) water and EM field generator and amplifier used the groundwater which submerged the pyramid in antiquity [music] or possibly mercury flowing underneath to create static electricity and I believe combined these processes were used as a means of opening a gateway to another world. When I first began to hear of the recent developments which have started to surface from deep beneath the Great Pyramid of Coffrey, with these massive columns now believed to be some 2 km in depth, rather than the measly 1 km first proposed, with the team now detailing
(07:08) how these pillars were also once made of a pizzo electric material and [music] each cut into helical coils to have encouraged the passage of water. One began to wonder, how could we go about establishing just what it is they were using these things for? What other clues may there be? not only found littering the remnants of what still remains upon the Giza Plateau, [music] but as mentioned within my previous video, found at sites such as what Sami Osmanag and his team are exposing within Bosnia, or indeed what has been found even
(07:42) further a field, which could possibly tie all of it together, or at least indicate [music] just what it is that these massive, mysterious structures now located and exposed all over for our planet [music] were once doing. For if my initial hypothesis correct, that the inclusion of water, a crucial element, and now with my confirmed suspicion of the additional inclusion of these [music] mysterious PZO electric materials, which have also turned up within the enormous underground cavity I recently shared with you, all found
(08:16) within Russia, believed by the team involved in the discovery to have indeed once been utilized in the capturing and converting of the vibrations of the earth. Then the work I already completed elsewhere must [music] have held more of the keys required to unravel this mystery.
(08:35) And I think that's exactly what I have found. The astonishing ancient hydraulic pump now exposed within the step pyramid of Joser which it must be noted is also very nearby to Kafrey and Kufu. The team of engineers responsible for the investigation now believe it once used to pump water somewhere. We also have the research surrounding the discovery of the presence of uranium 235 also known as yellow cake found within [music] the mastabas across the plateau.
(09:07) Also noting that these run all the way to the feet of the great pyramids themselves. This uranium some of which in a [music] depleted state still present within and now leeching into the surrounding earth. Yet, in addition to all of this evidence [music] of mysterious ancient energy generation, we also have the mysterious lakes of Mercury found worldwide, with one even revealed beneath the pyramid of the feathered serpent within Teotiwakan, Mexico.
(09:38) [music] And in our most recent expose, how the mysterious chambers within the great pyramid of Kufu next door to Cafrey, a seeming miniature model of what can be found [music] beneath the base of the Carfrey pyramid throughout this massive underground complex. [music] Thus, all one needed to do was put the pieces together. I now believe that the fifth element, or rather the ether, that the Reddit post refers to could have indeed played a role in the past function of these gigantic ancient energy generators.
(10:12) Perhaps, as Bostradamus states, also once used for the purpose of creating [music] portals to other dimensions or an unknown place, a location the Egyptians themselves referred to [music] as the underworld. For we have all long pondered the original purpose for the countless ancient seemingly false doors [snorts] which can not only be found across the Giza plateau [music] and Egypt as a whole in abundance but Peru, China, [music] India all over the world yet began as such a seemingly outlandish theory that perhaps this the very reason
(10:47) we have not established it as the reality of the matter that this indeed the true purpose for this [music] massive generation of energy. The mercury present within many of these sites, although baffling to any who follow along with [music] the mainstream account of history as to how these pools within Mexico and another I have shared, curiously found near to the Terracotta Army with each of these soldiers once a unique individual and also covered in a multi-dimensional paint yet that's for another [music] video was excavated or
(11:20) indeed could have come about. This mercury could have indeed been used in the protection against radiation just as we do today. And with the uranium found within the earth nearby [music] to this ancient pyramidal power plant upon the Giza plateau, I suspect it will also inevitably show up within ancient Egypt.
(11:40) The apparent miniature scale model within kios with its mysterious, utterly perplexing inner chambers, completely befuddling all who have attempted to explain them could in fact be the initial pump fed by the river via the hydraulics within the step pyramid of Joser with this hydraulic pump feeding the largest of the three pyramids.
(12:01) Thus, in reality, it the initial pumping [music] station which would send the water into and under the ground. with this PZO electric material, just as the Russian team had long ago concluded, within their own mysterious underground anomaly, possibly used in the harnessing of vibrational energy coming from the water and indeed the surrounding Earth, perhaps once creating a feedback loop via the utilization of the water, thus generating [music] simply unimaginable and seemingly limitless amounts of energy. And as such, perhaps even then,
(12:34) leading to the opening, [music] or for us, the reopening of these ancient false doors, anomalies many have long believed are indeed ancient [music] portals, [snorts] once inexplicably carved, and at great effort, into many unassuming rock faces, and into solid stone walls, which for [music] now seemingly lead to nowhere. Yet, I digress.
(12:58) Perhaps this generation of seemingly free and limitless power which the ancients would have had access to [music] via their tapping into what many would call the power of the planet or that of G itself. Also perhaps it the thing which Tesla had long claimed to have figured out in regards to the secrets [music] of the pyramids.
(13:18) Perhaps even this the reason as to why the study of the existence [music] or indeed the possible utilization of the mysterious ether was seemingly outlawed or at least mocked, prohibited and labeled pseudocience to hide this [music] secret from the wider world to prevent us from figuring out what these things are. Perhaps even to prevent us all from eventually establishing just where it is we came from.
(13:45) Did something happen in our distant past which caused these giant machines to stop working? Perhaps they themselves, [music] the thing which caused this great cataclysm. Perhaps they malfunctioned, causing them to apparently flood the entire planet. It's a mystery that is to be explained. [music] And with the mounting evidence compiled and corroborated, it could all indeed lead to the final unraveling of just what it is that these ancient structures and their massive underbelly of mechanics were doing and possibly
(14:19) creating via this generation of massive amounts of energy. Perhaps they open portals to the stars. Perhaps they open portals to another place entirely. [music] Regardless, it is a mystery which I will continue to find highly compelling. Please don't forget to like and subscribe to support my controversial research here upon YouTube. Thank you.
