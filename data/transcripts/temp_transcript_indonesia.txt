Transcript:
(00:04) Thanks to the countless discoveries which have connected ruins across our planet, out ofplace artifacts, items of intrigue, impossible feats of engineering and stone cutting, matching lost techniques, technologies, and so on. We may finally be arriving at a crossroads of human understanding, not only of our origins, but quite possibly reality [music] in and of itself.
(00:28) proof feverishly collected, researched, and ultimately shared with you all in an effort to reveal to the world the [music] existence of this now mysteriously missing yet once highly advanced civilization. In research into the origins of possibly the oldest yet little mentioned ancient pyramid on Earth, found buried within Indonesia, led by Danny Hillman Neta Jaja of the Indonesian Institute of Sciences and published in the journal Archaeological Perspection.
(00:56) The academics [music] write that quote, "The pyramid's core consists of meticulously sculpted massive andite lava, the oldest construction element of the pyramid, likely originated as a natural lava hill before being sculpted and then architecturally enveloped." They continue, "This study sheds light on advanced masonry skills dating back to the last glacial period.
(01:20) This finding challenges the conventional belief that human civilization and the development of advanced construction techniques emerged only with the advent of agriculture approximately 11,000 years ago. The academics also claim that the builders must have possessed remarkable masonry capabilities. Predictably, the finds have received incredible hostility from fellow academics with archaeologists around the world now attempting to rubbish the paper.
(01:47) Flint Dibble from Cardiff University told the journal Nature, "I am absolutely sure there is no clear evidence to suggest the buried layers were built by humans." Meanwhile, Bill Farley, an archaeologist at Southern Connecticut State University, has told the press, [music] quote, "The 27,000year-old soil samples from Gunnong Padang, although accurately dated, do not carry hallmarks of human activity such as charcoal [music] or bone fragments.
(02:16) Yet we feel and indeed from experience that even if these samples [music] did contain evidence of human activity, it would have simply been discredited and dismissed [music] along with said finds as mere coincidence. The site would still continue to be claimed as a natural formation. Yet, I digress. Natawi Jaja has responded to the criticism by saying [music] we are really open to researchers around the world who would like to come to Indonesia and do some research programs on Gunnong Padang.
(02:45) It would seem that Nadawi Ju is well aware of the overwhelming evidence to support his claims. Yet the academics attempting to trash his work seemingly reluctant to go to the site themselves. Do you not feel that this appears more to be a cover up than a pursuit of truth? If it were a pursuit of truth, then no matter how outlandish a claim seem on the surface, it would be within their duty to prove or disprove such claims as fact.
(03:09) Instead, they merely go along with an already established paradigm. And indeed, everything which fits in with this fallacy. Anything else must be rejected, discredited, and ignored. With the archaeologists who do prove these factors to themselves, [music] even then still unable to accept it as a reality, as if this truth forbidden, [music] punting in favor of these structures having been the work of an unknown species rather than the existence of a lost history.
(03:36) Who built the Gunnong Padang pyramid? Does Naawaja possess yet more proof corroborating the claims we have been making for over a decade? Are we arriving at critical mass where we see a paradigm shift towards the truth? I certainly hope so, for it will be a journey of discovery we shall all find highly compelling.
(03:55) There is a most peculiar ancient anomaly which sits hidden within a place known [music] as Hesca, very near to modern-day Barcelona, which local legends have long told [music] of as an ancient ruin, one left there by a lost ancient giant civilization known as the wall of Finestras and having [music] seemingly once cut right through the equally prehistoric waterway is a site I picked [music] to share with you in the past.
(04:25) Not only due to the aforementioned local legends telling of it having once been the work of ancient giants, quite possibly in their effort to dam [music] the water course, but also due to its unique shape, having two distinguishable piles, clearly reminiscent of [music] another ancient and also equally little understood relic, the Great Wall of China.
(04:47) However, and rather remarkably, it would seem that this ancient anomaly, long argued by academics as nothing more than a geological formation, is in fact not alone on this earth. For there [music] exists another, one that has been hiding right under our noses. It is known as the Devil's Slide, and it is located within Utah.
(05:11) Not only does this incredible outofplace ancient formation share the exact same shape as that of the wall of Finestras, but it too also linked to a water course and even local legends which tell of it having once been utilized for the purposes of [music] manipulating water flow. It is however again said to be a geological formation of [music] limestone some 170 million years old.
(05:36) Yet local legend tell of it once used by the devil himself, sliding down it into the lake for [music] his daily bath. According to local lore, Devil Slide owes its name to a railroad [music] worker named James John Walker, who apparently coined the term in 1868 after remarking that the formation looked like a slide fit for a devil.
(05:59) According to local lore, Devil Slide owes its name to a railroad worker named [music] James John Walker, who apparently coined the term in 1868 after remarking that the formation looked like a slide fit for a devil, how the academic who [music] provided this to the Cowboy State Daily Reporter knew this information, however, or where it was recorded, or indeed why somebody once recorded it is [music] unknown.
(06:26) Yet, according to the mainstream theory, locals would often name things after religious iconography to reflect their belief systems and their life's daily struggles with Linda Smith, historian for Morgan County, highlighting to a reporter in 2002 for the Desireette newspaper that over 61 sites are named after the devil just within Utah alone.
(06:48) Yet, there is another site in particular which I [music] have covered in the past, one also named after the great deceiver himself. and one that also has a long and murky legend attached. [music] It too claimed as geological. Yet again, many claim that it in fact a remnant of a [music] lost and possible giant ancient world, that being of course the Devil's [music] Tower within Wyoming.
(07:15) Could this name and reference be a tip of the hat to a [music] great deception? one which has successfully hidden these relics from us for all this time. Not only claiming them as mere geological formations, but mocking us via these names which they were all seemingly given. Why else would we have these strange academic accounts of where the names originated? I will of course look into the details, locations, and appearances of these 61 other sites which the historian Linda Smith mentioned in her remarks to the media to indeed seek out as to whether this
(07:48) theory holds any water. for the fact that such a great anomaly could be hidden from view in such [music] a way. Not to mention the many others I have shared with you in the past. Hidden all over the United States, such as the falling block within [music] Wyoming, the melted handprints upon the White Mountain, the gigantic quaries recently [music] discovered also within Utah.
(08:11) Perhaps giants the explanation [music] for how they cut, removed and lifted these blocks from the bedrock, the gigantic [music] prehistoric, often cyclopian walls across Montana with its many dolmans with all these hidden in plain sight. It is clearly not beyond the realms of possibility that [music] these are too.
(08:31) Thus, this remarking of the devil being involved, such as [music] the devil's slide, with another of the same name I have found just whilst doing this [music] research, located amongst the aforementioned simply gigantic megalithic ruins of [music] Montana, may also be a remnant of a now lost civilization. Thus, this reference could in fact turn out to be a road map [music] to identifying these lost ruins.
(08:57) I will of course keep you all posted on any further developments. What is the devil's slide in Utah? The one in Montana, or indeed the wall of finesters? Is there a lost world being hidden [music] from us in plain sight? It is a mystery which I continue to find highly compelling. [music] Could there be the remnant of a now lost yet once global super civilization still hidden across the United States? When we first began the channel, we covered the astonishing ancient megaliths that can be found within Montana.
(09:27) We soon came under attack from false DMCA claims surrounding this specific subject, which at the time nearly took out the channel. It would seem that the powers that be would have rather kept a lid on these ancient sites, which not only predate Native Americans, but demonstrate to the world the past capabilities of a now lost civilization.
(09:47) Like the falling block within Wyoming, still argued as a geological formation. The tool marks upon the falling block matching up to those found within Gaya Shorya, Aswan Quarry, Bazda caves in Turkey and so on. What we [music] have coined cup and scoop marks, these tools most synonymous with the unfinished obelisk.
(10:06) However, it is always helpful to find more sites a bit closer to home, ones which will support each other's artificial origins and corroborating their methodology of creation. not only supporting the posit of the falling block being an ancient abandoned megalith, [music] similar in origins to the stone of the pregnant woman, but furthering our understanding of the reach of this now [music] lost civilization.
(10:28) With this fortunately being the case in Utah, where we may have stumbled upon the source quarry for Wyoming's falling block, a site spared modern excavation and/or destruction due to its inconspicuous natural appearance. Its true purpose visible only to those who understand the methods of ancient stone extraction and indeed [music] are looking for it.
(10:51) This cut block quarrying being a technique not only still used with modern machinery within modern quaries but is visible worldwide in countless other ancient and abandoned quaries such as Olanti Tambbo or indeed throughout Peru. Located at Mui Point, this prehistoric quarry of gigantic proportions shares [music] some startling similarities to those of Aswan, Easter Island, China, and so on.
(11:14) All abruptly abandoned, all moving, cutting, and shaping monstrous rocks, sizes which we would struggle to move today, once lending support to the geological angle. Yet their similarities and artificial man-made characteristics [music] undeniable. For these formations to all appear in such close proximity, each sharing the same artificial characteristics ignored in favor of this geological argument, we feel is clear evidence of a conspiracy.
(11:41) Yet, I digress. To assume that a civilization seemingly capable of scooping out solid stone did not possess advanced technology we feel is a mistake. To presume that this civilization with all these evident capabilities and similarities in construction [music] methods found globally were not seafaring worldgoing peoples, we feel is becoming more and more the ignorant choice in regard to lost antiquity [music] day by day.
(12:08) To dismiss such a hypothesis in favor of putting the mounting and already [music] mountainous evidence in support down to coincidence becoming more and more suspicious, [music] especially from academic fields. What happened to this civilization? What could they have been building? Why was everything within ancient times built to such gigantic proportions? Was this civilization larger in scale than us or just incredibly capable? Wanting to create a legacy they knew would be lost, but they desired to be rediscovered? If so, why?
(12:38) Are there even more astonishing pre flood ruins and indeed megalithic quaries still hidden across the [music] United States? We find the possibilities highly compelling. There are many ancient unexplained ruins which have long been suppressed and in some cases [music] completely covered up, found scattered across the United States of America.
(13:00) [music] Remnants of a prehistoric civilization which the powers [music] that be would rather have remained hidden. Megalithic ruins rivaling even that of Balbeck found throughout Montana. Recently discovered enormous megalithic quaries throughout Utah. The falling block or melted handprints within Wyoming and so on.
(13:25) A literal smorgas board of ancient relics which have all successfully been ignored, [music] hidden throughout the states. This lack of academic attention [music] which these sites receive, one could perceive as rather suspicious. This of course if one were not aware that in reality this a concerted effort which has long been put into hiding many factors of our ancient past.
(13:50) Many of which some claim now sit within the [music] vaults of particular institutes. Yet the biggest of these unsolved ancient mysteries, [music] undoubtedly Earth's countless ancient pyramids. I have in the past covered the littlest studied and even lesser [music] explored submerged pyramid within Wisconsin, or indeed the incredibly old pyramid [music] hidden within Dakota.
(14:14) Yet like that of the long claimed Great Pyramid, which once sat tall within Salt Lake City, once somehow constructed of solid copper blocks, our next item of interest was also seemingly quarried out, or possibly simply destroyed in this ongoing effort to hide the true grandeur of our planet's lost civilizations.
(14:36) Found within Pyramid Lake, one of the largest lakes within America, is a strange yet uncanny rock formation. This formation not only dated to over 300 million years old, but within the original documentation and indeed illustrations of the area created by the first pioneers, just like that of the surviving evidence for the recently covered copper pyramid, [music] which once stood within Salt Lake City, can be seen to have itself indeed once [music] been a clearly man-made pyramid, which once stood proudly within this
(15:13) ancient lake. [music] perhaps even once utilizing it as a water source. The question is what happened to this mysterious [music] anomaly? Could the many other artifacts we have found often [music] discovered perfectly preserved within prehistoric strata and coal seams dating to this [music] exact same age not only supporting the existence of human civilization spanning back to these times [music] but corroborate the claim that this along with the great pyramids [music] which still stand within Egypt specifically its core stones [music]
(15:47) ones I have long postulated are now obscured and covered by later conservation efforts not a mere few thousand years but quite possibly hundreds of millions [music] of years old. Perhaps this along with the original purpose [music] having long ago been unraveled surrounding the past function of these ancient structures.
(16:10) the actual true motive behind why this pyramid along with many others I have [music] encountered during my research for the channel not just within the states but worldwide destroyed [music] hidden or attached to civilizations clearly incapable of [music] such feats. This then perhaps all in an effort to conceal their true past function.
(16:34) I will keep you posted on any further explorations [music] or confirmations of ancient human activity discovered within Pyramid Lake. It is a [music] mystery which I find highly compelling with the wide and varied array of ancient and in some cases prehistoric artifacts which have now been shared here upon our channel now found and located all over our earth.
(17:01) One would expect that the proposition of human history spanning hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions of years would be more warmly received. [snorts] Yet alas, with past popularization of such hypothesis as that of the Bearing Straight Landbridge, such a reality continues to be denied, suppressed, and dismissed.
(17:22) There exists many accusations of elaborate hoaxes which attach themselves to these objects. Sometimes shady institutions and academics will even resort to stealing these unexplainable artifacts in the middle of trusted examinations with many of them having vanished this way [snorts] and always in an effort to prevent the truth from reaching the public to protect and uphold current paradigms.
(17:46) Fallacies which all those responsible for covering up these discoveries well aware of what they are doing and indeed what they are hiding. Yet, there are those few most peculiar of finds, such as the discovery of a hen's egg, for instance, found firmly embedded in sand 33 ft below the surface that are so out of place they not only hard to bury, but almost impossible to dismiss.
(18:12) [music] Quote, "It [snorts] was in good condition and found when sinking a well in Plain Grove Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania." Upon the egg being broken, it appeared fresh for an instant, but mysteriously and rapidly spoiled within a mere few minutes of being exposed to the air. End quote.
(18:34) [music] Found recorded within the Philadelphia public ledger for July 28th, 1858. or the report from May 11th, 1864 within the true democrat of Lewistown, Mifflin County, also in Pennsylvania, found under the heading, a wonderful discovery. It details a find made at rolling mill of wood morel and company Cambria County. While workers were laying foundations for a new business whilst using a large piece of sandstone, a frog appeared from the slab once it cut in [music] two.
(19:06) Quote, "Pressed as flat as a scent, and lying in a crevice in the stone, a reptile which was plump, and when it fell out, appeared to be blind. The stone had been quarried from spurs of Laurel Hill some 30 years previously." End quote. Such finds simply cannot be explained away as natural or historical anomalies. Yet, such incredible discoveries continue to be ignored on mass.
(19:33) With many reports over the past century alone of living creatures somehow being found in tmbed, seemingly frozen in time for untold millennia, [music] yet upon resurfacing into the world, appear completely unchanged. Yet there are other finds which, although not preserved in an inexplicable living state, thanks to the locations in which they met their untimely demise, no less astonishingly preserved as that of our fellow amphibians.
(20:01) And our next items of interest are of no exception. In the winter of 1993, in the Cherabad salt mines, south of Hamzu village on the western side of the city of Zenjan within Iran, miners would stumble upon an ancient human perfectly preserved with long hair, beard, and in possession of an enormous array of compelling artifacts.
(20:26) These included leather boots, iron knives, wool and half trousers, a silver needle, a sling, parts of a leather rope, a grindstone, a walnut, some pottery shards, and varying patterned textile fragments. Discovered within the middle of a man-made ancient tunnel carved into the salt deposit of approximately 45 m in length.
(20:51) It wouldn't be long before individuals funded by numerous mainstream academic institutes would eagerly volunteer their services in investigating and indeed dating the finds. In 2004, the remains of a second man and then in 2005, two more along with a female were discovered. In 2006, the Iranian Cultural Heritage Agency, the German Mining Museum, the University of Oxford, and the Swiss University of Zurich would join forces for a thorough investigation of the discovery, starting a scientific long-term project, which was academically supported and funded by
(21:31) Deutsche Forunhaft or DFG, and also numerous British funds. After archaeological studies, which included C14 dings of different samples of bones and textiles, the Saltman was dated to about 1,700 years ago. However, the officially disclosed dates do indeed vary by some 2 to 300 years apart from each other, although they all clearly from the same group.
(22:00) Thus, their true possible age due to the advanced artifacts found could perhaps be far older than is being claimed. Additionally, and rather predictably, possibly supporting such a conspiracy, by 2008, the mine was abruptly shut down, and any further permittance to explore or even mine the area now continually forbidden and denied.
(22:23) There could of course be many more preserved bodies and indeed controversial artifacts present within the ancient salt mine. Yet it also equally as possible this denial of further investigations made to allow for covert exploration of these possible pre flood peoples and indeed the complete seizure and suppression of any further artifacts and remains by a certain institute whom shall remain unnamed.
(22:50) Who were the saltman of Iran? Just how old could they be? are the artifacts which they were found with proof of ancient man's advanced knowledge and abilities, particularly in regards to metallurgy. Were they part of a now lost yet pre flood civilization with perhaps [music] the biggest mystery still unanswered surrounding the saltmen? Why were they here in the first place? Were they like the modern man mining salt? If so, how did they find this deposit to begin with? Has the mine itself, the salt within, like that of
(23:29) the location of the Alura man, allowed for these people to remain perfectly preserved, perhaps for hundreds of thousands of years. They are a collection of remarkable out ofplace anomalies, which I continue to find highly compelling.
