(00:00) Have you heard the news that multiple scientists have confirmed that the hidden mega structures beneath Egypt's Giza pyramids are in existence? In a new interview on Jesse Michelle's The American Alchemy podcast, Beyond revealed that four independent satellite operators, Umbra, Capella Space, Eki, and Italy's Cosmo Skyd have all returned identical [music] raw tomography data that shows the same structures buried on the Giza Plateau.
(00:32) And all four gave exactly [music] the same results. For decades, for centuries even, and maybe even millennia, the Giza [music] Plateau has been presented as a puzzle solved. Three great pyramids, the Sphinx, a few pyramid satellites, [music] tombs, causeways, temples. But beneath the surface, quite literally, a growing number of researchers, engineers, and independent investigators believe [music] the real story of the Giza Plateau has only just scratched the surface.
(01:07) And so, the truth about these ancient mega wonders will suddenly be revealed in the years ahead. Maybe, just maybe. Over the past few years, Armando May and Trevor Grassi through online platforms [music] and the group often referred to as Giza or the Caffrey Research Project, they have been posting claims that new subterranean structures have been identified beneath the pyramid of Caffrey and the Great Sphinx.
(01:36) And they go even further than this, stating that a sandfilled passage [music] connects the Sphinx to the Cafrey Pyramid and may be soon cleared, potentially opening access to unknown underground features [music] in 2026. So, what exactly are they finding? What do they expect to uncover next? And how does this compare [music] to what mainstream archaeology currently accepts? Wait to hear this.
(02:04) According to recent posts, live streams and discussions shared by Armando May and Trevor Grassi, recent analysis suggests that subsurface structures exist beneath the pyramid of Caffrey and [music] they extend deeper than previously acknowledged. They go as far to say that an underground passageway or corridor may link the Great Sphinx to the pyramid of Caffrey.
(02:30) The research team say that portions of this corridor are believed to be filled with sand and debris and that they will clear this in 2026. [music] Clearing this material, they say, could allow physical access to deeper underground chambers. and the Cafrey Project have framed the year 2026, this year now as a critical year, one in which they expect [music] major revelations assuming access and clearance can proceed from the Egyptian antiquities authorities.
(03:02) And it should be noted that these claims are being shared outside of traditional academic [music] channels, primarily through social media and independent research presentations. The Cafrey project research [music] team, they claim to have used synthetic aperture radar SER technology and Doppler-based tomographic techniques to analyze subsurface features beneath the Giza plateau.
(03:27) And through their interpretations, it suggests that geometric anomalies are beneath the Cafrey pyramid, possible multi-level underground chambers, vertical shaftlike features, and a broader subterranean network that extends beyond those those known structures. In the visual reconstructions that they have shared online, these features appear highly structured, not random voids or fractures, and are interpreted by supporters as evidence of intentional underground architecture.
(04:02) As of now, no excavation permits have been publicly issued to clear or explore underground passages beneath the Cafrey Pyramid or the Great Sphinx. Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities have not confirmed the existence of new structures as described by this research team and Zahi Hawas have rejected these claims as unsupported by established archaeological evidence.
(04:27) The Giza plateau is already known to be subterranean. Tunnels, shafts, and chambers have been known to exist beneath [music] the Great Sphinx with water erosion channels, causeways, and even unfinished passageways. well documented. Modern projects like the scan pyramids and the muon radiography studies have confirmed hidden voids, though this is on a much smaller scale than claimed by the cafrey project research team or gizatlogy.
(04:58) For now, Armando May and Trevor Grassi say that the next steps involved are clearing sandfilled corridors beneath the connected Sphinx and Pyramid of Cafe complex, physically accessing underground spaces identified via remote sensing, and documenting these chambers, these shafts, and structures that are featured previously inaccessible.
(05:23) Could this be a re-evaluation of the Pyramid of Cafre's foundations? evidenced of a more older and more complex phase of construction at the Giza complex and possible confirmation of a connected underground system. However, and this is crucial, none of this can proceed without Egyptian authority and no confirmed excavation schedule has yet been announced.
(05:51) Giza is not fully understood. Every generation discovers something new. a void here, a passage there, an anomaly. This reminds us that much remains hidden beneath the Giza Plateau. And whether 2026 brings a breakthrough or a reckoning, the discussion itself forces an important question. Are we truly done exploring Giza? Or have we only scratched the surface?
