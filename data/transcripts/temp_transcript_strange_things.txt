Transcript:
(00:05) A rumor recently began to circulate within old yet very familiar circles surrounding a newly made groundbreaking discovery deep within that of the Great Pyramid with Zahi Hawas himself revealing to the press that in 2026 a discovery will be made public that is set to quote rewrite the history of the pyramids.
(00:30) One has to wonder what this discovery could be. What could it contain? [music] Could it be that they will finally reveal once and for all the true purpose for these great ancient structures? [music] Perhaps revealing details which could lead or at least indicate its true age or perhaps more importantly [music] how they accomplished such a feat so far back within history.
(00:54) Although many may still hold out hope for such a revelation, [music] I have long pertained that Hawas, Egyptian antiquities, and indeed any investigative explorations which go on within these secretive spaces to be heavily restricted, redacted [music] or controlled. I would even go so far as to postulate they actively conceal these artifacts [music] and evidences from the wider world.
(01:19) And once one begins to see the larger picture at play here, indeed just how the following developments and discoveries are disseminated into the wider world, you too may begin to suspect this nothing more than a drip feed of information. Not only to maintain the current status [music] quo, but to slow the inevitable realization by this same greater population as to the true origin and indeed [music] history of these wondrous pyramids.
(01:46) For although Zahi has long claimed that his mission is to find the final resting places [music] and indeed tombs of such figures as that of Nefertiti, you may begin to suspect that he too knows far more about these three giant mysteries than initially meets the eye. In 1993, for the first time in known history, he would make [music] the strange and controversial decision to close the Great Pyramid off from the general public for an entire [music] year.
(02:16) Initially made under the guise of conservation, attempting to balance out the number of public eyes peering into these unmissable buildings with his publicly [music] declared goal to prevent evaporation from the many bodies which traverse its gallery floors and tunnels from damaging the structures. Undertaking the removal of salt, [music] which he states had quote encrusted the gallery walls in a thick layer.
(02:41) [snorts] With this not being the first removal of such a [music] mysterious deposit, with one once quietly removed from the lower chambers before they were ever opened to the general [music] public, a residual piece of evidence not left by human bodies, but a global cataclysmic [music] flood, the evidence for which I have found and subsequently exposed all over our planet.
(03:04) [music] Thus, for now, I digress. This salt removal and conservation effort, however, would eventually and most conveniently lead [music] to the first of many astonishing discoveries made within the dark and dusty corners of this massive structure. Thus, it would appear upon the surface that [music] whilst the public and most notably the media were conveniently locked out far away, the [snorts] find of the century [music] would reportedly be made within.
(03:34) [snorts] now known as Ganten [music] Brink's door and supposedly found by complete accident while Zahi was reportedly attempting to solve the air circulation problem within. [snorts] By utilizing the infamous shafts already and originally incorporated into the structure, Genbrink along with his groundbreaking [music] robotic technology would discover secret passages, tiny doors, and most likely secret chambers which I hypothesize have been [music] kept under wraps ever since.
(04:04) Zahi would later write, quote, "The shafts were originally discovered in [music] September of 1872 by British engineer Wayneman Dixon." Dixon had pushed [music] a wire through the joints of the masonry of the south wall and realized there was a hollow space [music] behind it. He then chiseled through the wall and found the southern shaft.
(04:28) He looked [music] for a shaft in the equivalent area of the north wall and found one. When he lit a candle and placed it in the southern shaft, it flickered, telling him that there was a slight draft. During the 1993 explorations of the Queen's chamber shafts, Gantenbrink made [music] some intriguing finds. The northern shaft turned sharply to the west after approximately 27 ft, and the robot [music] could go no farther.
(04:57) In the southern shaft, the robot was again stopped [music] after 208 ft by a door or small slab with two copper handles that blocked the entire shaft. The left handle had lost a piece sometime in antiquity which was lying about 6 ft [music] in front of the door. In September 2003, we sent another robot into the shafts to find out what was behind [music] the door.
(05:23) We opened a hole 1 cm in diameter and we sent a camera through the hole, finding yet another door just some 21 cm beyond [music] the first one. We also sent the robot into the northern air shaft and found that after 20 m the shaft bent and continued for another 8. This bend may indicate that it was designed to miss the Grand Gallery and it also explains that it was carved during the construction of the pyramid.
(05:49) The robot continued [music] for another 60 m and then stopped in front of a door with two copper handles. It is the [music] same distance as the door within the southern shaft with it too possessing two copper handles. End quote. With these shafts known of, even explored and revealed [music] to contain openings to other passages, secret shafts, and even unknown chambers within the pyramid all the way back in 1872.
(06:17) One has to wonder just what else has been discovered within since. What profound [music] understandings of what these things were, or indeed their past function, [music] has been kept secret, keeping us in the dark merely to uphold what I claimed to be nothing more than a myth, a lie once generated by the Egyptians themselves [music] in a deceptive yet successful attempted display of power and abilities.
(06:43) And [music] with Zahi Hawas now coming out to the press to declare another discovery, if we go by previous finds, with the last declared all the way back within 2003, with a notable decade between the exhibitions, whatever this expose may be, it will most likely be sterilized of any information which could lead one to prove once and for all, either way, just who built this place.
(07:09) for the mystery not only more profitable but possibly even part of the original purpose for their creation. For perhaps the journey to the discovery more valuable than the discovery itself. Yet regardless, one has [music] to know and I will endeavor to keep you all updated on whatever it is they find and if there is indeed anything [music] they miss or mistakenly expose of substance.
(07:35) What do you think Zahi Hawas and indeed Egyptian antiquities as a whole are going to publicly reveal the find to be? Will it as before be yet another looted chamber claimed as having somehow been robbed in antiquity even though [music] it found deep within the pyramids in penetrable bowels and also only accessible with the use of modern robotic [music] technology? Or will we finally get a valid explanation for what these things once were? Whatever it could be, I find its [music] existence and indeed the entirety of the Great Pyramids
(08:10) themselves highly compelling. >> We have measured approximately over 1 kilometer of depth. >> Over a kilometer of depth. >> Do you think that the pyramid was a nuclear fusion machine? Please give me another another request. I don't know. Maybe the water goes through these spirals and the spirals are made by PZO electric material.
(08:40) >> You think we can turn the power grid back on? >> We do like that. >> There is a theory, perhaps even a lore which has long existed here upon the internet. [snorts] For it is said that if one doesn't know something and has run out of places to look, [music] instead of spending hours on the telephone talking to support lines, [music] or spending thousands on a course, simply search out that anonymous prophetic hero who knew this day would come to pass, having posted everything one wished to [music] know within a
(09:15) small and succinct thread several years before upon Reddit. And as such, before we began, I would like to bring to your attention the following post. Created some eight years ago under the account name of Bradamus. Quote, is it mere chance that the four elements of classical philosophy were always represented as triangles? I think not.
(09:42) The pyramid was a device used for harnessing the fifth element. It's definitely atomic, which is why we find mercury beneath pyramids across the world. It's used to diminish the effects of radioactive waste [music] as we do today. The element of fire is equivalent to the nuclear reaction with the pyramid also functioning as the element wind, an acoustic resonance chamber that was designed to push vibrations upwards.
(10:08) water and EM field generator and amplifier used the groundwater which submerged the pyramid in antiquity or possibly mercury flowing underneath to create static electricity and I believe combined these processes were used as a means of opening a gateway to another world. End quote. When I first began to hear of the recent developments which have started to surface from deep [music] beneath the Great Pyramid of Coffrey with these massive columns now believed to be some 2 km in depth rather than the measly 1 km first proposed with the team now
(10:45) detailing how these pillars were also once made of a pizzo electric material and each cut into helical coils to have encouraged the passage of water. One began to wonder, how could we go about establishing just what it is they were using these things for? What other clues may there be? not only found littering the remnants of what still remains upon the Giza [music] Plateau, but as mentioned within my previous video, found at sites such as what Samir Osmanag and his team are exposing within Bosnia, [music] or indeed what has been
(11:19) found even further a field, which could possibly tie all of it together, or at least [music] indicate just what it is that these massive, mysterious structures [music] now located and exposed all over for our planet were once doing. For if my initial hypothesis correct that the inclusion of water a crucial element, and now with my confirmed suspicion of the additional inclusion of these mysterious PZO electric materials, [music] which have also turned up within the enormous underground cavity I recently shared
(11:53) with you, all found within Russia, believed by the team involved in the discovery to have indeed once been utilized in the capturing and converting of the vibrations of the earth. Then the work I already completed elsewhere must [music] have held more of the keys required to unravel this mystery. And I think that's exactly what I have found.
(12:15) The astonishing ancient hydraulic pump now exposed within the step pyramid of Joser [music] which it must be noted is also very nearby to Kafrey and Kufu. The team of engineers responsible for the investigation now believe it once used to pump water somewhere. [music] We also have the research surrounding the discovery of the presence of uranium 235, also known as yellow cake, found within the mastabas across the plateau.
(12:43) [music] Also noting that these run all the way to the feet of the great pyramids themselves. This uranium, some of which in [music] a depleted state, still present within and now leeching into the surrounding earth. Yet, in addition to all of this evidence [music] of mysterious ancient energy generation, we also have the mysterious lakes of Mercury found worldwide, with one even revealed [music] beneath the pyramid of the feathered serpent within Teotiwakan, Mexico.
(13:15) And in our most recent expose, how the mysterious chambers [music] within the great pyramid of Kufu next door to Cafrey, a seeming miniature model of [music] what can be found beneath the base of the Carfrey pyramid throughout this [music] massive underground complex. Thus, all one needed to do was [music] put the pieces together.
(13:37) I now believe that the fifth element, [music] or rather the ether that the Reddit post refers to, could have indeed played a role in the past [music] function of these gigantic ancient energy generators. Perhaps, as Bostradamus states, also once used for the purpose of creating portals [music] to other dimensions or an unknown place, a location the Egyptians themselves referred to [music] as the underworld.
(14:04) For we have all long pondered the original purpose [music] for the countless ancient seemingly false doors which can not only be found across the [music] Giza plateau and Egypt as a whole in abundance but Peru, China, [music] India all over the world yet began as such a seemingly outlandish [music] theory that perhaps this the very reason we have not established it as the reality of the matter that this indeed the true purpose for [music] this massive generation of energy.
(14:33) The mercury present within many of these sites, although baffling to any who follow along with the mainstream account of history as to how these pools within Mexico and another I have shared, curiously found near to the Terracotta Army with each of these soldiers once a unique individual and also covered in a multi-dimensional paint yet that's [music] for another video was excavated or indeed could have come about.
(14:59) This mercury could have indeed been used in the protection against radiation just as we do today. And with the uranium found within the earth nearby to this ancient pyramidal power plant upon the Giza plateau, I suspect it will also inevitably show up within ancient Egypt. The apparent miniature scale model within kioss with its [music] mysterious, utterly perplexing inner chambers, completely befuddling all who have attempted to explain them, could in fact be the initial pump fed by the river via the hydraulics within the step
(15:32) pyramid of [music] Joser [snorts] with this hydraulic pump feeding the largest of the three pyramids. Thus, in reality, it the [music] initial pumping station which would send the water into and under the ground. with this PZO electric material, just as the Russian team had long ago concluded, within their own mysterious underground anomaly, possibly used in the harnessing of vibrational energy coming from the water and indeed the surrounding Earth, perhaps once creating a feedback loop via the utilization of the water, thus
(16:05) generating simply [music] unimaginable and seemingly limitless amounts of energy. And as such, perhaps even then, leading to the opening, or for us, the reopening of these ancient false doors, anomalies many have long believed are indeed [music] ancient portals, once inexplicably carved, and at great effort [music] into many unassuming rock faces, and into solid stone walls, which for now seemingly lead to nowhere.
(16:32) [music] Yet, I digress. Perhaps this generation of seemingly free and limitless power which the ancients would have had access to via their tapping into what many would call the power of the planet or that of G itself. Also perhaps it the thing which Tesla had long claimed to have figured out in regards to the secrets [music] of the pyramids.
(16:57) Perhaps even this the reason as to why the study of the existence or indeed the possible utilization of the mysterious ether was seemingly outlawed or at least mocked, prohibited and labeled [music] pseudocience to hide this secret from the wider world to prevent us from figuring out what these things are. Perhaps even to prevent us all from eventually establishing just where it is we came from.
(17:23) Did something happen in our distant past which caused [music] these giant machines to stop working? Perhaps they themselves, the thing which caused this great cataclysm. Perhaps they malfunctioned, [music] causing them to apparently flood the entire planet. It's a [music] mystery that is to be explained.
(17:43) And with the mounting evidence compiled and corroborated, it could all indeed lead to the final unraveling of just what it is that these ancient structures and their massive underbelly of mechanics were doing and possibly creating via this generation of massive amounts of energy. Perhaps they open portals to the stars.
(18:05) Perhaps they open portals to another place entirely. [music] Regardless, it is a mystery which I will continue to find highly compelling. Some rather compelling claims and evidence [music] have surfaced over the years within Ireland. All demonstrating a strong mysterious and it would appear [music] for some reason seemingly concealed connection with none other than [music] that of ancient Egypt with pharaohs, queens, and even entire entouragees all told of visiting this small [music] island.
(18:41) Yet the reason why a complete mystery within a small quiet corner of Ireland in a place known as [music] Wexford, a woman by the name of Lady Olivia Dera Robertson can be found. told of as [music] the head of the fellowship of Isis. And although I have no idea what this secret society [music] is or indeed what they may already know and perhaps are protecting surrounding the existence of this ancient link, she revealed during a long one-on-one interview with an independent researcher many [music] highly compelling pieces of evidence
(19:14) which if true suggest a once mysterious, secret, even intimate relationship which once existed between Ireland and the rulers of ancient Egypt. Whilst researching the validity of her claims, [music] he would search for any officially made yet not publicly known studies which may have been undertaken in the past [music] surrounding the hypothesis.
(19:37) He searched for any artifacts or literature [music] which may have surfaced over the years which would back up her claims. And within the dark and dusty archives of Trinity College, he would find just that, an archaeological report telling of a completely baffling discovery made way back in the 1950s [music] during an exploratory dig upon what is known as the Hill of Tara.
(20:04) Found [music] within a second trench placed upon the mound of hostages, the team would unearth a peculiar-looking small [music] skeleton, initially presuming it to be a child. Yet, when an anthropologist [music] looked into the find a little closer, they would realize instead of a child, it was [music] in fact that of an ancient baboon.
(20:26) Within [music] the grave goods, gold and ceramic beads were also discovered. And once again, when the team sent them away for forensic examination, they were completely baffled [music] by the results. with the chemical structure of the beads revealed to be around 97% [music] identical to that of beads found within ancient Egyptian tombs with some later [music] turning up within the burial goods of none other than Toutin Common found to be a perfect match.
(20:55) Thus, their origins are undeniable with the carbon dating of the baboon [music] showing that it was also buried in around 1300 BC. The evidence [music] to suggest that this primate was once part of a great ancient Egyptian royal entourage is overwhelming. Yet, the mystery as to why they were here remains unsolved. >> [music] >> However, Irish myths have long circulated around the legend, with one in particular surrounding that of the Queen Scota, [music] who is now even popularly known as the Egyptian Queen of the Scots, which tell of an Egyptian
(21:32) queen and her Greek husband, who upon being exiled from Egypt end up in Ireland at some point during the second millennium BC. Chased from their homeland, they would take to the sea, settling [music] in Spain and then Ireland. It is said that it was from these names, Queen Scota [music] and King Gaos, the modern words Scottish and Gaelic are derived.
(21:59) with these early tales fortunately recorded within a 14th century book known as the Scott [music] Chronicon. Although hotly debated for many years, with many dismissing the claims as nothing more than a conspiracy, [music] could this quietly made and suspiciously quietly kept discovery, perhaps one among many others, which were once decidedly buried within academia's archives, prove once and for all that the legends of a queen of Egypt [music] in Ireland were true all along.
(22:35) a queen also rumored to have been the daughter of none other [music] than that of Akenatan. I will endeavor to dig deeper into this compelling lead and try to uncover any other intriguing [music] slithers of evidence which may have surfaced over the years. Yet their existence for now merely resigned to the archival bowels of academic [music] institutions.
(22:58) What do you think about this puzzling, seemingly concealed ancient link between Egypt and Ireland? What is the fellowship of Isis? Are there any other stories or finds surrounding this particular legend yet to be exposed? I will, of course, keep you all posted. It is a little [music] known, peculiar, and rarely publicized mystery which I find highly compelling.
