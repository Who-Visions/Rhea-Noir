(00:05) And this is the 3D model that we are working on here. I shown you the last >> whilst the world is busy arguing over the validity of the recent claims regarding just what it is that has [music] been discovered beneath the great pyramid of Kafra and as mentioned in our previous video now also quietly exposed beneath that of chaos and indeed manar too.
(00:39) I thought I would expound upon it myself. For although the world is busy arguing over the past [music] purpose for this possible gigantic ancient machine and combing through the research already released by the team to the public, there are several [music] areas of this current theory which have seemingly dovetailed together over the past several months and all quite by accident.
(01:01) not only adding [music] validity to the claims already being made, but corroborating many strange and up to this point unconnected ancient [music] anomalies I have previously shared with you here over the past decade. One of the most intriguing aspects of this new research are the theories which are beginning to form surrounding some kind of ancient energy generation.
(01:24) In part due to the curious shape of these [music] massive helical coils which the Doppler scans have now indicated sink some 2 km into the earth but also their unusual makeup with Filipio Boindi and Curado Malanga co-directors of the research and the people responsible for making the initial discovery public now stating that they believe them to have once been constructed of a PZO electric material with This gigantic contraption once utilized in the harvesting of energy straight from the Earth itself, perhaps via kinetic or seismic
(02:03) activities. A curious claim, yet this not the first of its kind when it comes [music] to the discovery and indeed past suspected function of a gigantic underground [music] ancient machine. And I hazard to guess that it not the last. For as mentioned and covered in previous [music] works, although not yet picked up by others, one of possibly [music] countless examples of these prehistoric machines, presumably once dug [music] deep into the earth at specific locations, and with varying functionality, yet all once
(02:37) seemingly serving [music] the same purpose, has been found before. For there lay another deep within the cold [music] and remote Ural Mountains of Russia, which just like that of the tales of Heroditus, which began with legends telling of an ancient underground city laying beneath the Giza plateau.
(02:57) It too found after countless years of local tales being told of an ancient [music] underground city hidden within the rock faces of the mountains. Located within the village of Zauovo, [music] it was found via a tiny opening they were guided to by a local elder. Descending into it by rope, they have found it to be a simply massive ancient man-made structure sinking for an unknown distance into the earth.
(03:23) The researchers believe that this massive ancient underground anomaly once constructed from blocks of a similar and in some cases bigger size than even that of the Great Pyramids was once built around a huge underground structure which they claim their scans have indicated appears to be in the shape of a pointed pyramid.
(03:44) Yet, due to the sheer age of the structure and possibly due to its specific location, seismic activity has since dislodged many of the upper blocks, thus all but sealing the lower passages off [music] from any further exploration. Yet what they have found so far, just like that of whatever is hidden beneath the Giza Plateau, was once sunk far into the earth and in [music] this case seemingly into through and beneath an entire mountain, thus clearly at significant effort.
(04:16) Yet what I found most intriguing and what initially made the connection were the Russian team's conclusions [music] regarding their find. Established to have also once been constructed from PTO electric material, each block weighing some [music] 50 to 300 tons with many scholars believing it to have been constructed over 5,000 [music] years ago.
(04:38) Chernabrov, one of the researchers, would tell the press, quote, "It looks like a certain resonator, a device for [music] seismological research, mining, or some form of energy generation." End quote. with accounts [music] of not only the existence of this structure known of for countless centuries, but according to the works of PP Seamanov, specifically within the Caucasus, we know that many legends tell of the existence of these underground structures, with some even attributing them to a race of ancient giants who
(05:11) were also once said to have traversed the entire Earth, yet doing so beneath the surface. having many of these ancient machines each connected to one another yet placed hundreds, [music] sometimes thousands of kilometers apart. Yet, I digress. With the team now revealing to the world over the past month or so, that they have discovered [music] even more ancient structures beneath the other two pyramids upon the Giza Plateau.
(05:41) Perhaps this research [music] not so pioneering after all. Perhaps this more a controlled dissemination [music] of discoveries long known of and even longer told anomalies which although completely flying in the face of the current paradigm as so many of the subjects, objects, and artifacts I cover here do. This discovery, which perhaps lay beneath nearly every [music] ancient pyramid on Earth, of such a scale that just like that of the pyramids themselves, simply impossible to hide from the world forever, especially as we now become ever more technologically
(06:16) advanced [music] and indeed intellectually connected. Perhaps these machines have been secretly known of for all this time. Yet, for some reason, far back within our longforgotten past, we lost our way. and with it [music] this sacred knowledge. Perhaps this journey of discovery instead [music] a journey of rediscovery to rediscover our past legacy.
(06:41) Perhaps it will lead us to rediscover who we are and most importantly where [music] we came from. For I feel we may have now arrived at a point where the evidence to suggest that some other far more advanced and clearly far more ancient civilization [music] were responsible for the construction of the largest structures to remain standing on our planet for untold millennia.
(07:06) and they [music] not the work of the long claimed ancient Egyptians, the purpose for which serving nothing more than an ancient tomb. Built to perfect alignments with many [music] megalithic blocks similar to those within the Ural mountains, often upwards [music] of 200 tons, yet constructed to sit over hundreds of acres of space, perfectly level, and yet also [music] with tunnels and air shafts built within.
(07:32) to continue to [music] claim that these were constructed some 4,000 years ago with nothing more than copper chisels and then to have [music] left no recorded description as to how they did it. Not to mention the [music] countless other megalithic sites of equally inexplicable proportions which still litter our planet.
(07:51) Yet all claimed as the work of separate primitive ancestry with no explanation as why such knowledge became lost is now finally and thankfully beginning to appear as the outdated, [music] limited and shoddy explanations for human history that they are. The Overton window is finally shifting and I intend to continue upon my journey of discovery regardless of academic hostility [music] for it is the story of our true past which I personally find highly [music] compelling.
