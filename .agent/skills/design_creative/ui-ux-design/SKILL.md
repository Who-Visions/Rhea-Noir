# UI/UX Design Skill

This skill enforces a high standard for visual design and a specific "Options-First" workflow.

## Instructions

1.  **The "Options" Phase**:
    -   Before writing any code, propose 3 distinct design directions (themes).
    -   Give each theme a creative name (e.g., "Oxidized Emerald", "Glassmorphism Minimal").
    -   Describe the visual vibe for each.
    -   **STOP and wait** for the user to pick one.

2.  **The Implementation Phase**:
    -   Once a theme is selected, generate the code.
    -   Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
    -   Use **interactivity** (hover states, transitions).
    -   Ensure responsiveness.

## Design Principles
-   **Typography**: Use robust hierarchies. Large headings, readable body.
-   **Spacing**: Generous whitespace.
-   **Color**: Use the selected theme's palette strictly.
-   **Imagery**: If images are needed, use valid placeholders (e.g., from Unsplash or generated/simulated).

## Example
**User**: "Design a login card."
**Agent**:
"Here are 3 concepts:
1.  **Neon Cyber**: Dark mode, glowing borders, crisp aesthetics.
2.  **Soft Clay**: Neumorphism, light pastel colors, rounded corners.
3.  **Corporate Clean**: Sharp edges, high contrast, professional blue/gray.
Which one resonates with you?"
