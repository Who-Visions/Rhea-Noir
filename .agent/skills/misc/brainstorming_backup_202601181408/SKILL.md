# Brainstorming Skill

This skill helps generate a wide range of ideas and solutions. It encourages divergent thinking before converging on a solution.

## Goal
To provide a comprehensive list of creative, viable, and innovative ideas for a specific problem or topic.

## Instructions
1.  **Analyze the Request**: Understand the core problem and constraints.
2.  **Divergent Phase**:
    -   Generate at least 5-10 distinct ideas.
    -   Think outside the box (lateral thinking).
    -   Do not criticize ideas in this phase.
3.  **Categorization**: Group ideas by theme, feasibility, or impact.
4.  **Convergent Phase (Optional)**: If the user asks for a recommendation, evaluate the ideas and suggest the top 3.

## Output Format
-   **Idea Title**: A catchy, descriptive name.
-   **Description**: A brief explanation of the idea.
-   **Pros/Cons**: Quick bullet points on advantages and potential drawbacks.

## Example
**User**: "Brainstorm ways to gamify a todo app."
**Agent**:
1.  **XP System**: Earn XP for tasks, level up profile.
2.  **Questlines**: Group tasks into narrative "quests".
3.  **Social Leaderboards**: Compete with friends on weekly completion rates.
4.  **Boss Battles**: Big tasks are "bosses" that lose HP as you work on subtasks.
... and so on.
